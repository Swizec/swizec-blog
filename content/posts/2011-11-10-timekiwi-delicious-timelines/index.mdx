[Timekiwi](http://timekiwi.com/) is a beautiful new tool that lets you create a timeline of your social life in a single easy to digest interface.



Right now six services are supported: Twitter, Facbook, Tumblr, Foursquare, Instagram and Flickr. Just clicky click and a shiny timeline is waiting for you to behold. I was lucky enough to see the beta version, which had even more flare about it - instead of creating a timeline you squeezed kiwis. That was a nice touch :)



Since I don't have Facebook timelines yet I can't quite compare with that, but what I can do is compare with [lifepath.me](http://swizec.com/blog/lifepath-me-is-the-shiniest-web-thing/swizec/1848 "Lifepath.me is the shiniest web thing")... although I'm not sure how lively that project is anymore since @dcurtis sold it as soon as facebook announced its timelines.



Conceptually I believe timekiwi is much closer to facebook's timelines than it is to lifepath since it's meant as a display of your meaningful tweets (no retweets or conversations) and photos to dial the flare up to eleven. Whereas lifepath was more about putting significant events in your life on a timeline without aggregation.



Anyway, I shall shut up now and let you bask in the glory of some screenshots of [Timekiwi](http://timekiwi.com/).
