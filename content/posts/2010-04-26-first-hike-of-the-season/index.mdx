For the past &lt;all of my life> years I've been forced to go hiking now and anon by my nature nutter mum.



Then last year I started contracting the bug and sort of _wanted_ to go a few times.



This year I totally want to go for a good hike at least once a month.



Weird right? Does this mean I'm getting old? Or just that I spend too much time inside?



Whatever it is, yesterday the girlfriend and I went for a lovely hike. The first of the season. The destination was this [observation tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_tower "Observation tower") thing upon some hill above Vrhnika.



[I foursquared](http://foursquare.com/venue/2957164) when we were there of course :P



The hike was quite lovely through some woods and such, many birds were chirping and there were no mammals in sight except for some cyclist a dog or two and a few children. There were also some humans.



An hour of walking each way ... it hurt a lot more than I thought it would. No soreness today, but it was surprisingly hard yesterday and I felt strangely sleepy as early as midnight. Maybe I'm just not at all in shape yet?



Anyhow, here are two photos of the purdiful view we got from the top of the tower.
