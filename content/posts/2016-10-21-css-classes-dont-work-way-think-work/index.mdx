    <p class="blue green red">This is some text</p>

Which color is this text going to be?



No cheating, give it a think ?? . . . . Blue. The answer is blue. ? Look. I’m not lying. It’s really blue.

You can use any permutation of `blue green red` – the text is still blue. Try it! Edit the codepen. Play around :) Did you find the pattern? CSS classes apply in the order in which they are defined, not the order in which they are invoked. This is _not_ intuitive. Look: if you switch around the CSS rules, the text becomes red.

Same HTML, same CSS classes, different order of definitions. Try it; change the code. Maybe this is obvious to everyone but me, but I spent an embarrassing amount of time yesterday and today debugging some React components. It hits you when common components have default styling, and you want to override it in a specific instance.

    const P = ({ className, children }) => (
        

    {children}


    ); // default P

    // ...

    const Error = ({ errorText }) => (
        

    Red error!


    ); // doesn't become red

The generic `P` component returns a `<p>` element with an `italic` and a `blue` class. You can expect text to be italic and blue by default. Please don’t do that in real life. This is just an example. It takes a `className` prop so you can extend classes used. But when you use the `Error` component, which produces `<p class="italic blue red">Red error!</p>`, it’s not red. It’s blue because your CSS defines `.red` first and `.blue` second. ? There is no workaround. This is expected behavior. The [relevant part](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#specificity) of W3C spec makes no mention of HTML attribute ordering. How did I go 15 years without ever noticing? ?
