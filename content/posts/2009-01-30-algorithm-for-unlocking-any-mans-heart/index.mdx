For the past few days I've been partaking in a rather vibrant forum thread celebrating the male to female differences. It started off with a school mate asking for photos of our female school mates, presumably because he's horny and too lazy to go looking for chicks at the faculty himself. But I decided to make a thread out of it and started trolling, so it quickly grew up to be a lofty six page thread of halfseriousnes and halfmockery of all that is feminism. Most of all, I was later told that it's earned me a slap from a lass I've yet to meet. Guess I'll know when I meet her!

Part of the thread was devoted to romance and even though I proposed a purely hypothetical idea of what us male humans like to find romantic, strangely enough many others quite agreed to a point and even stranger, one of the girls seems to have run an experiment on her boyfriend and discovered that my hypothesis holds. Wewt for me!

So, if we give extrapolating an algorithm out of the whole ordeal a shot we get something like this ... I should really draw a graph ... hmm let's see if I have a tool for it. \*consults twitter\*
