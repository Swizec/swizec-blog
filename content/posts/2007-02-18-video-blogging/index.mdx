A few days ago I decided to give video ranting a go and after having videod three rants in a matter of fiteeen minutes this morning I'm rather certain this new thing is here to stay. It's easier, better, and it makes me look sillier. The only problem is I don't have boobies and people seem to enjoy those the most in such things, but I'm sure some can be procured.
