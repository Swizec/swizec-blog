[As I predicted last month](https://swizec.com/blog/march-2017-sidehustle-report/swizec/7540), April was a down month. It was the lowest earning month of the year so far, but it wasnâ€™t quite as bad as I expected.



I took 2 weeks off the sidehustle. I did nothing but enjoy Europe and make [a daily vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL3pGjTlvio&list=PLF8WgaD4xmjUn5WldUkcy6YH1vLt7zbAx). There was next-to-no activity on social media, I ignored my email inbox, I ignored Twitter, and I mostly ignored Facebook.



No new technical content, nothing really.



And yet, $2529 of revenue. Either the daily vlog drove sales, thus proving my hypothesis that _"Publishing anything at all, no matter what, drives sales"_, or I have a solid baseline and my time spent writing articles, livecoding, and making videos is mostly wasted effort.



Then again, I enjoy doing it. It's my idea incubator, and it does improve sales by a few thousand dollars. _shrug_



Here's how it breaks down.



**Total revenue:** $2529



**Gumroad sales:** $857



- React D3v4 preorders: $98 - fees
- ES6 Cheatsheet: $7 - fees
- React D3 ES6: $955 - fees



\*\*Leanpub sales: \*\* $309



- React D3: $22
- React D3 ES6: $287



\*\*React Native School: \*\* $1361



\*\*Time investment: \*\* 68 hours



**Costs:** $1837



- Editor: $500
- VA: $368
- Ads: $422
- Drip: $184
- Hosting: $10
- LiveEdu account: $10
- SumoMe: $99
- Mailchimp: $20
- Stock music: $99
- CreativeCommons music: $12
- Tech: $113



For the life of me, I can't remember what tech purchase I made for $113. I'm sure it was necessary ðŸ¤”



The biggest waste of money was the stock music purchase. It seemed like a great idea for the vlogs, but all their stuff had that awful "this is stock audio" feel to it. The [Creative Commons music on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/creativecommonsmusicfree) sounds a lot better.



\*\*Net hourly rate: \*\* $10



Based on hourly rate economics, daily vlogging looks like a waste of time after all. â€™Twas a fun experiment, tho.
