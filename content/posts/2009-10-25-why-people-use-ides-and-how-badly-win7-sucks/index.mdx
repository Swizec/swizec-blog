Just a quick thought on an early morning ...



After having battled with the quintessential question of modern programming for several years I have finally figured out why people use IDE's and why many of them are so adamant about having this and that gizmo and this and that helping view and whatnot cluttering their work environment.



It's all because they're **still** using an OS \*cough\*windows\*cough\* that doesn't support [virtual desktops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop "Virtual desktop"). What. The. Fuck. Why would anyone DO that? O.o ... makes no sense whatsoever



What's perhaps even funnier is that even Windows 7 doesn't support virtual desktops. This, in my humblest of opinions, makes it antiquated by roughly 10 years at its release. Sad.
