Saturday afternoon I decided I was ready to unleash [my book](https://leanpub.com/nightowls) on the world. Or rather, the 0.1 extremely unfinished draft version of the book.

Consider a book that's about 6000 words long, most chapters are just outlines and the most developed chapter is missing two \\important sections. Selling this almost sounds like a bad joke.



However, after a few weeks of work and estimated reading time breaching the 30 minute mark, it was time to run the next experiment in the series - _will people part with money for this?_



Using Leanpub allows me to run this sort of experiment with a clear conscience. People pay however much they want and they're getting future updates for free - they are basically paying for a future finished book.



Set the minimum price at _$1.73,_ the suggested price at _$3.14_ click publish, create a few coupons, post to reddit and twitter and away we go!



Mentally, I drew a line in the sand at 10 sales. That would let me know this book is worth my time.



**883 readers** and _**272 sales**_ later ... oh boy!



The book reached frontpage for several hours both on r/programming and on [HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com/ "Hacker News"), amounting to a total of 23,203 [unique visitors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_user "Unique user") and 28k pageviews.

HN referrred just over 8000 visitors, who used HN's [promo code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon "Coupon") _240 times_. The 7500 people from Reddit used theirs_362 times_. Promo codes made the book completely free, by the way. It's also [hosted in full on Github](https://github.com/Swizec/nightowls), so it's not like I was forcing people to pay me money so they can read a draft of the book.



The book made a total of _$959.88_ in sales, of which I get a _$730.40_ cut in royalties. Much better than going with just about any other publisher - I was recently contacted with a promise of 16% royalties. And I really have a lot to thank Leanpub for, they made publishing the book dead simple and have invested all the work in having a landing page that converts.



Here's the really cool part though; out of everyone who paid, **_77%_**__ paid more than minimal price and a whopping **_38%_**__ more than suggested price.



Great success!



_And I can't even put a price on all the useful feedback I received._
