Been listening to the [llama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama "Llama") song a lot lately and was reminded of all the brilliant [memes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme "Meme") that existed on the internets long before there was youtube or anything like web2.0. It was quite a different time in our lives and accordingly the humor was much different as well.



Enjoy these old classics, do hope you still remember them.
