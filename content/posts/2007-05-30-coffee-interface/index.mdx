This video shows the future. It is a 20 year old future, but still the future even now. It's a coffee table, display, user interface hybrid and I believe it's looking very useful. Due to posture issues it can never replace a computer, but for a tool at meetings and such it definitely looks awesome.

Wonder what happens when you spill the coffee though.
