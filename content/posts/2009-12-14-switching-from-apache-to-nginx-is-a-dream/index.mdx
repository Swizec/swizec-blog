Since as far back as my memory goes I've been using [Apache](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server "Apache HTTP Server") for my main, primary, and absolutely only [webserver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server "Web server"). It was the workhorse of everything from dev environments to production machines serving tens of pages. But throughout this love affair there was one constant - I had to change things. This isn't bad. Of course when you first start using [mod_rewrite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_engine "Rewrite engine") you're going to have to change things and naturally adding a new website on a new domain means changing a few things. No problem here, all natural. But still, there was a certain feeling that rose up in me like a mad urge, a feeling of endless power and proportion, a feeling like, hey, I've had sex with this woman a few times, and I quite like it, but there's something missing something isn't quite right, why can't I watch a good movie instead of having this sex thing? That's right, it was the**Sense of Impending Doom.**Because you see dearies, whenever you have to make a small change in the apache configs a small part of your soul dies. You know it's supposed to be a small change, you know it's supposed to be effortless, but despite having done this countless times, you still waste an hour making everything work. This Saturday I finally stomped my foot like a little school girl and said ENOUGH! Then I installed nginx. It was a bit daunting at first and I may still not know how to pronounce the name, but I love it. The damn thing is sooper fast and when I had to add a config for a new site ... hah! Took three lines of code, sure it was only for serving static files, but the same thing in apache takes a separate file, then a vhost, then blahlbah. Fuck you! Here's an example, come on, would you see anything so sleek and awesome under Apache? Ever?

```
server {
                listen localhost:80;
                server_name lestat;

                root /var/www;
                index index.html;
        }
```

Now obviously I don't know how to do fancy rewrites and stuff yet, but from what I've seen so far, I think nginx and Swizec are a match made in heaven for the foreseeable future. So there you go @[robertbasic](http://twitter.com/robertbasic "Robert Basic"), @genom, @loudandwicked, @jaspertandy ... a blog post about the change. PS: about versatility and such that @genom mentioned, I haven't a bloody clue (yet) PS2: apologies to everyone I mentioned in the post and didn't link to, Zemanta didn't suggest the links and I'm too lazy to do them manugally.
