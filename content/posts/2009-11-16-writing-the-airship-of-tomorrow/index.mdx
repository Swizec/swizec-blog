[![Steampunk_Air_Ship_by_Swizec2](./img/Steampunk_Air_Ship_by_Swizec2-300x212.jpg "Steampunk_Air_Ship_by_Swizec2")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Steampunk_Air_Ship_by_Swizec2.jpg) This was a little essay I wrote as one Richard Von Tropp advocating the use of airships as a superior type of flying machinery to fixed wing aircraft and even proposing some ways in which to merge the two concepts constructively. It was published in issue #3 of Steampunk Magazine. Give it a read please :P [The AirShip of Tomorrow](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/The-AirShip-of-Tomorrow.doc)
