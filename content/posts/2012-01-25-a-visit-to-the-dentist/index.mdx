It took me six months to work up the courage to make an appointment for the [dentist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentist "Dentist"). After some [initial confusion](http://swizec.com/blog/going-to-the-dentist-is-like-trying-out-a-new-opensource-project/swizec/2881 "Going to the dentist is like trying out a new opensource project")I finally managed to bump into someone and magically make an appointment before I could realize what was going on. \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Image via Wikipedia"][![An image from 1300s (A.D.)

1.  My teeth are made of magic
2.  I am far more afraid of dentists than I had thought

Ever heard of the expression _white with fear_? Turns out it can actually happen. Just like Tom turns completely white when a train is rushing towards him, so too my face turned white when I was sitting in that damn chair. Nearly fainted too. I never did like dentists much - seven years since my last appointment after all - but to _nearly faint_ from fear? Nausea, tunnel vision, white face; the whole shebang! Didn't even feel that bad, but you know shit's going down when the dentist removes your glasses "just in case" and puts a wet rag on your forehead. Lucky for me, I have magical teeth and the tally from all the years of neglect is just:

-   one broken filling
-   three [wisdom teeth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_tooth "Wisdom tooth") with some caries
-   inflamed gums

None of that _OMG my wisdom teeth are breaking my head and trying to destroy everything!!!_ I honestly expected much worse, but hey, I'll take the deal ;) It also turns out I suck at keeping my mouth open and will be having much fun the next time I visit ... something about working on the back teeth and not being able to get the drill completely vertical and maybe not even being able to work on them ... Now my face feels funny from the injection, the _optional_ injection. Can't imagine the amounts of pain there would be had I not told them that yes, yes I do want that injection thing. You did notice I almost fainted when you were just _cleaning_ my teeth right? WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME THIS!? Those things take a while to really kick in. She was almost done drilling before I stopped feeling everything and even then just the air blowing over my teeth hurt like _hell._ Not to even mention the disinfectant. Another appointment in a few weeks and then I guess I'm good to go for another seven years. Right?
