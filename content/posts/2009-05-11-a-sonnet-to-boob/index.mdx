Miss Boob, miss Boob with your shape so plump you excite and you annoy little babies, dear,

are hungry so, and yet you only let men play. Like a peacock you display your warm soft charms, dear,

are horrible nightmares of girls well endowed and women left behind cherrish the attention, dear,

all I have for you is love, in my heart I hold you dear.

This is a little ditty I slapped together after being challenged by one Ceridwen to find a way of joining together the topics of Shakespeare and my girlfriend. Naturally I couldn't pass up the challenge and since a dramaturgist I am not and there was once a time when I thought of myself as a bit of a poet the humble [sonnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet "Sonnet") was an obvious choice.



However, the careful observer will note that the only semblance of a sonnet in this poem is the stanza structure, there is no rhyme to speak of - so not a sonnet, and the verse doesn't follow a ten syllable lambic pentameter either ... but hey, it was fun to write.



Just for the record, the whole intertwining of sentences and meaning between stanzas is just a little something I've lately picked up from Wilde's [Charmides](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Charmides_(Wilde)) and [The Burden of Itys](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Burden_of_Itys).
