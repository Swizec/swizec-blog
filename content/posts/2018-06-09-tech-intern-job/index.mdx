Here's the deal, I'm a solopreneur working nights and weekends on this _Turn programmers into engineers_ business and I have more ideas than time. So I'm looking for an intern to help me out.





Why an intern? Three reasons:



1. I don't think there's enough work for an experienced software engineer
2. I think the tasks wouldn't be challenging enough for an experienced engineer
3. Cost; this is a small bootstrapped business



## What I'm offering



I can't promise you piles of money and I can't say you're going to build software used by millions. Such is life :)



What I _can_ offer is a paid learning opportunity.



You'll work remotely and part-time to implement various solutions big and small in JavaScript, React, and associated web technologies. We'll start small and go bigger as time goes on.



I don't care where in the world you are, as long as your English is good enough that we can understand each other smoothly.



When you hit a snag, I'm here to help. If you need to buy a book or a course to learn something, I will buy it for you.



Think of this as a way to practice solving real problems. You are encouraged to leverage this experience into finding a real real job.



## Your job



Your job will be to implement things I don't have time for, so I can focus on producing content. This will involve:



- improvements to swizec.com
- building features for learnwhileyoupoop.com
- evaluating opensource libraries
- building example code
- build and improve landing pages



The tech stack is a combination of React and Wordpress. You're encouraged to leverage existing solutions instead of reinventing the wheel.



## How we'll work together



We're going to communicate primarily through Slack. Video calls when necessary.



We're going to have daily checkins and generally keep in touch while working together. You are encouraged to reach out to me whenever.



You'll be paid via PayPal or TransferWise every month based on an hourly rate we'll figure out together. If neither PayPal nor TransferWise work for you, we can figure something out.



## How we'll find out if we're a fit



For hiring, I'm prioritizing [slope instead of y-intercept](http://qr.ae/TUphry). That is to say, I want you to be a fast learner not someone who already knows a lot.



You should have basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, HTML, etc. I'll give you the chance to learn the rest.



The initial hiring process is going to go like this:



- you've already reached out to me, probably üëçüèº (unless you're reading this on my blog)
- after too long a wait, I replied (sorry üòÖ)
- you send me something you've made
- **I teach you something**
- **you use the concept to build an example app**
- I'll use what you've built to gauge your slope



My hope is that even if we don't end up working together, you will still have learned something useful and built a little something you can add to your portfolio. That way I'm not wasting your time.



### Next step



Our next step is a **live webinar on June 13th at 9pm Pacific** on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/SwizecTeller).



If you can't make it, don't worry. The video will stay available forever, but I encourage you to come say hi and ask questions. This is your chance to evaluate me as well.



We're going to cover an intermediate React concept or two.

If all that sounds good, see you at the webinar. Hit reply, send me something you've built (school and book/course projects are perfect), and ask your questions :)
