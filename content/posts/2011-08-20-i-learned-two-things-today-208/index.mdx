Today I learned that despite being the biggest carnivore you are likely to meet I can actually enjoy a vegan lunch when it's done right. Was on a shopping spree in San Francisco today because I need some clothes and they're somewhat cheap this side of the pond. Part of the trip involved lunch and we went to an interesting place on Valencia called [Herbivore](http://www.herbivorerestaurant.com/).



It's a fully vegan restaurant that actually serves good food. The fake chicken I ate was so awesome I would never have guessed it wasn't real chicken if I didn't know in advance.



Another thing I learned is that in the US it is in fact possible to get pulled over by a cop while riding a bicycle. Got confused at a very big crossroads and somehow ended up running a red light in a very very confused manner. Wanted to go left, but I couldn't, then the lights started changing and everything went south quick.



Whoo-whoop from a police bike and I was explaining myself to a cop. Got out scot free simply because I'm foreign and weird, but was told in a very sarcastic manner that here in the US you are supposed to stop when the light is red :D
