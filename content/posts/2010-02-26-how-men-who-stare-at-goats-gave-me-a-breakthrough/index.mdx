Last night I was faced with a daunting task of making a [meta-heuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic "Metaheuristic") process a non-trivial amount of data in no more than a tenth of the time it was taking now.



Just to help you embrace the herculean task this was: My goal was to make the algorithm's runtime lower than 1.5 seconds for any realistic data sample. It was taking anywhere from 5 to 20 and even 30 seconds at the time.



So I set off. First some profiling and some tidbits here and there, then tweaking and poking and yanking and scraping code for _hours upon hours upon hours._



Nothing, no increase in performance. Nothing even remote to sane behaviour at all. Even though the algorithm was working, my debugging/profiling data wasn't making any sense.



And I said fuck this shit and went to chillax and rest my mind over [Men Who Stare at Goats](http://www.amazon.com/Men-Who-Stare-at-Goats/dp/0330375482%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0330375482 "Men Who Stare at Goats") for two hours.





There were some good laughs and some pretty good chillaxing being done. My I-don't-know-which-exactly-or-what's-it-called part of the brain was probably busy processing the afore mentioned problem in the background. Or maybe it wasn't, who knows.



All I know is that when I came back to the problem I noticed something funky.



HEY THAT FUNCTION ARGUMENT SHOULDN'T BE A FUCKING CONSTANT WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!



Characters 1 and t look a lot alike ...



So anyway, long story short. The meta-heuristic that used to take 1500 epochs to do something now takes only _**ten**_ to do the same thing, but slightly better.



That's a pretty fucking good improovement right there!



Now the algorithm is constantly taking about a second to do its thing and I'm happy. Pushed it into production where profiling data will be collected of a more varied sample of data to see if all is well.



Chillaxing! It really does work.
