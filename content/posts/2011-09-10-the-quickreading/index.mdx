Today I learned that quickreading scientific text isn't all that quick at all. I have a theoretical exam on [information theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory") on Tuesday and to start off the studying I wanted to read [Shannon's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") original paper on the topic, all 55 pages of it. Seeming as how quickreading is a little bit like opening a broadband pipeline from the text right into my brain ... well turns out quickreading 55 pages liberally sprinkled with [mathematical formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula "Formula") takes just over an hour. And I don't feel like I've gotten much out of reading the thing, certainly nothing more than I already had a grasp of studying for the practical part of the exam. At least it was an interesting read. Another thing I discovered today is that with the addition of a wireless keyboard, [the iPad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad "IPad") is in fact a useful device. Shocker! After my laptop keyboard started spazzing out following the August Spill, I fired up Pages on the iPad and was well on the way ... except for the special [Slovene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language "Slovene language") letters because the iPad is oh so clever and you can't tell it to use a keyboard layout different than what the keyboard considers native. Silly thing.
