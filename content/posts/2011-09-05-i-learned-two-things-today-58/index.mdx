Today I learned that an abundance of studying can be damaging to the brain and general well-being of a person.



You can tell something is wrong when at some point you find yourself trying to calculate the [expected value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value "Expected value") of a [random variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable") defined as {2,2,2,2,2,2,2} using the long form. And you even use so much sense as to shorten everything up by just multiplying the sum of all probabilities with 2! (essentiall 2\*1)



Yep, I actually wrote out two whole members of the [summation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation "Summation") series before realizing what I was doing ...



Another thing I learned is that I actually did write down that [thing I said yesterday I didn't write down](http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-4-8/swizec/2357 "I learned two things today 4.8."), but forgot I had written it down. What I had learned yesterday was that levenshtein distance and hamming distance are pretty similar beasts. The first is a measure of the number of changes you need to perform to turn a string into a different string, whereas the latter is only about the number of substitutions to be performed.



And yes, that passes for super interesting these days.
