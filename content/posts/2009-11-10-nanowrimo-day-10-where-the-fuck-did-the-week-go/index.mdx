It's been a while since I wrote anything for my Gonzo Steampunk Vampires, which is a shame since this story actually seems to be turning out a lot better than anything I've ever written (although it's still mostly crap) and as a reader of my brain I'm, surprisingly, starting to get a sense that there's something deeper behind the front tale. That there will be some meat on the bones of this story. All of this makes me yay! What does not make me yay is my complete and utter failure at writing. Despite having to write every day I haven't done anything in so long that today when I wanted to do some writing during a break between lectures I ... I ... I forgot where my story was. I completely and totally forgot what I was supposed to write! But in any regard, here are the 724 words I managed to muster today, hope you like 'em

> Moe rushed into class; wet under his nose, shoes pooling with water and the dumbest look on his face ever imaginable. A draft pulled the door from his hand and shut it closed. A deathly quiet filled the lecture hall.
