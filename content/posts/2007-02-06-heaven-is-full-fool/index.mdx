So it has come to my attention today that heaven, known as Low Earth Orbit to normal people, [has officially reached critical mass](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/science/space/06orbi.html?ex=1328418000&en=16b9c6ba615c2e62&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss) and we are in trouble if nothing is done about it.
