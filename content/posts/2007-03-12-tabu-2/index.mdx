Last night my memory was tricked into remembering [Tabu](http://www.t-a-b-u.com/), a Slovene band I used to quite enjoy when I was quite some younger. Naturally I went to youtube and tried to see what I could have a listen to but alas there was naught to be found, which of course lead to doing what any responsible adult would - going to their website, stealing all the videos they make available and putting them on youtube. Hope they don't mind the free publicity.
