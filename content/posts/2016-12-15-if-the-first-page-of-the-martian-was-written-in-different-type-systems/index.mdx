Or: How Types Influence Readability.



## Traditional static typed



_Where the compiler knows nothing you don't tell the compiler._



`KNOWLEDGEREPOSITORY` LOG `ELEMENT` ENTRY: `DATE` SOL 6



`Human` I'm `Opinion` pretty much fucked.



`Opinion` That's my considered opinion.



`Opinion` Fucked.



`Timespan` Six days into `Opinion` what should be the `Opinion` greatest `Timespan` month of `Timespan` my life, and what should be the greatest month of my life `TypeConversion` turned into a `Opinion` nightmare.



I `Opinion` don't even know `ManyHumans` who'll `Activity` read LOG. I `Activity` guess `ManyHumans` someone will `Activity` find LOG `Timespan` eventually. `Opinion` Maybe a `Timespan` hundred years from now.



`RhetoricDevice` For the record… I `Activity` didn't die on `Date` Sol 6. `Opinion` Certainly `ManyHumans` the rest of the crew `Opinion` thought I did, and I can't `Activity` blame the rest of the crew. Maybe there'll be `Timespan` a day of `Activity` national mourning for `Human` me, and `KnowledgeRepository` my Wikipedia page will say, `Quote` "Mark Watney is the only human being to have died on Mars."



## Untyped



_Where the compiler knows nothing and you're pretty sure it's impossible to explain how your code works to a machine._



THING: SOL 6



Individual pretty much fucked.



That's something.



Fucked.



Six days into experience, and experience's turned into a thing.



Individual don't even know stuff. Individual guess someone will a discovery. Maybe in future.



For the record… person didn't something on Sol 6. Certainly other people thought person did, and individual can't blame people. Maybe there'll be future something for me, and my thing will say, "Mark Watney is the only human being to have died on Mars."



## Local type inference



_Where the compiler can often guess what you mean._



`KNOWLEDGEREPOSITORY` LOG `ELEMENT` ENTRY: `DATE` SOL 6



`Human` I'm `Opinion` pretty much fucked.



That's my considered opinion.



Fucked.



`Timespan` Six days into `Opinion` what should be the `Opinion` greatest `Timespan` month of my life, and it's turned into a `Opinion` nightmare.



I `Opinion` don't even know `ManyHumans` who'll `Activity` read LOG. I guess someone will `Activity` find it eventually. `Opinion` Maybe a hundred years from now.



`RhetoricDevice` For the record… I `Activity` didn't die on Sol 6. `Opinion` Certainly `ManyHumans` the rest of the crew `Opinion` thought I did, and I can't `Activity` blame them. Maybe there'll be a day of `Activity` national mourning for me, and `KnowledgeRepository` my Wikipedia page will say, `Quote` "Mark Watney is the only human being to have died on Mars."



## Global type inference



_Where the compiler knows everything – often more than you._



LOG ENTRY: SOL 6



I'm pretty much fucked.



That's my considered opinion.



Fucked.



Six days into what should be the greatest month of my life, and it's turned into a nightmare.



I don't even know who'll read this. I guess someone will find it eventually. Maybe a hundred years from now.



For the record… I didn't die on Sol 6. Certainly the rest of the crew thought I did, and I can't blame them. Maybe there'll be a day of national mourning for me, and my Wikipedia page will say, "Mark Watney is the only human being to have died on Mars."



## My point?



People don't hate on old skool static typing because typing types is hard. They hate on it because it's annoying to read.



The pendulum swung too far with untyped languages, and our code is nice to read but hard to understand. We're getting back on track with [sufficiently smart compilers](http://wiki.c2.com/?SufficientlySmartCompiler) and type inference.



The future is bright.
