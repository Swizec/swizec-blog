My code has never looked so beautiful! https&#x3A;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=3goTf93srNM Monitor reviews are a very visual affair. Watch the video üëÜ Got my [LG UltraFine 5K 27" from Amazon](http://amzn.to/2C3SlsD). Mine was a refurb, so I saved about $500 from full price. Your luck may vary. Here's a quick rundown for the impatient üëá https&#x3A;//twitter.com/Swizec/status/940112462447198208 **Pros**

-   gorgeous picture
-   **so many** pixels 5120x2880
-   seriously, my code looks like it's printed on paper üòç
-   one cable to rule them all (same cable charges your laptop and connects everything)
-   3 USB-C ports, works as a hub
-   USB-C connection should have enough bandwidth for a lot of peripherals
-   _amazing_ built-in speakers, no more muffled bassy sound
-   okay webcam
-   adjustable height and 2-directional tilt
-   light yet sturdy
-   design looks üëå

**Cons**

-   USB-C only, you need to buy a hub (I got one with USB + ethernet + SDcards, duct-taped it to the back)
-   doesn't seem to adjust brightness to ambient light
-   13" macbook pro from 2017 struggles a bit
-   15" macbook pro with top spec GPU can't run games in full 5K
-   too many pixels, gotta be careful when taking screenshots (must resize, big files)
-   super expensive
-   completely unnecessary for most daily tasks
-   MacOS sometimes does wonky things with USB-C connections like crash your computer if you plug and unplug impatiently
-   doesn't give you more screen real estate room than a normal 27" monitor (not at "native" resolution at least)

The reason I went for 5K instead of just 4K are the Amazon reviews that say _"Don't get a 27" 4K, MacOS does funny things"_. Something about not being able to run at native resolution so you either get suuuuuper tiny visuals, or everything's blurry. Your only options are a 24" 4K or a 27" 5K. I hear 32" 4K works great too, but my desk isn't big enough. **Verdict** 2017 is still too early for 5K. There are only 2 monitors on the market, [the LG](http://amzn.to/2C3SlsD) and the Dell, and they're both expensive as hell. Laptops have trouble driving the full resolution for anything interesting, and you don't get more real estate than normal. It's a fancy toy, looks great, your eyes will love you. But if you have a working monitor, I'd wait a few more years for 5K to become the norm.
