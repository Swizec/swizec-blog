You know how some mornings you wake up, jump out of bed, and you're full of piss and vinegar and ready to take on the world? ![](./img/giphy.gif) And other days you wake up and it's like you got hit by a cement truck rolling down the hill with no brakes? ![](./img/giphy.gif) That. I was going to write today about either [Constate](https://github.com/diegohaz/constate) and how much I love it for state management, especially with hooks, or about building webapps with [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). But writing feels a lot like dragging barbed wire through my brain right now, so here's a 2-hour livecoding session instead. We worked on building a webapp with Gatsby and using Constate for state management. https&#x3A;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwyOQqi7Xm8 We continue tonight, and on Wednesday, you get an article about it. Deal?

## Tips & tricks I learned this week

Let's try a new section for these wonderful Monday emails. Every day, I try to write 200 words about something new I learned. The cute little posts go on to live or die on Twitter and Facebook. But you're my favorite, so I should share them here as well.

1.  [An important lesson about JavaScript testing](https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1082551586696491008). You really really have to make sure tests don't run in PhantomJS by accident.
2.  [Getting help on Twitter can be absolutely fantastic](https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1082918465537695744)
3.  [Out-of-box Rails caching isn't actually that useful](https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1083634802194972672)
4.  [Novelty makes teaching and sharing easy](https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1084291659829936129). Preserving that enthusiasm as a grizzled veteran ain't easy
5.  [README.md is great basic documentation, but you need more](https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1084698389797695488)

## A few cool things

Here's a bunch of cool things I discovered this week.

-   [BestOfJS](https://risingstars.js.org/2018/en/) released their 2018 findings of most popular repositories. Interestingly Vue is the most popular frontend framework, but the most popular full-stack frameworks and site builders are all based on React. ðŸ¤”
-   [react-simple-img](https://github.com/bluebill1049/react-simple-img) is like a better version of my [react-lazyload-fadein](https://github.com/Swizec/react-lazyload-fadein) component.
-   The Towards Data Science blog published [a really cool study of SF Bay Area commuter regions](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-does-the-bay-area-commute-22f45e00419e?gi=a507c2eb50ff). I need to find time to do more machine learning, it's amazing for things like this.
-   [This Pew Research are you middle class](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/06/are-you-in-the-american-middle-class/) calculator is a beautiful example of how even very simple data visuals can greatly enhance a story.
-   And here's one I've been meaning to share for a while ðŸ‘‰ [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) is an amazing independent blog that publishes data-based stories with beautiful visualizations. Great for inspiration.
