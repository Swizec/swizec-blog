_This is a Livecoding Recap â€“ an almost-weekly post about interesting things discovered while livecoding. Usually shorter than 500 words. Often with pictures. Livecoding happens almost **every Sunday at 2pm PDT** on multiple channels. You should follow [My Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoyHgaeLLI7Knp7LDHOwZMw) channel to catch me live._ I channeled my inner Darth Vader yet again. Still don't know why my sound is garbled on YouTube, but works on LiveEdu. They're both using the same stream ðŸ˜•  This weekend, I wanted to try out [`react-navigation`](https://reactnavigation.org/) because I've heard a lot about it. Supposed to be the big new (official) thing since `Navigator` was deprecated in April. So I set out to build a travel app. You say where you're going, app tells you what to pack. I have no idea where I'm going to get lists of what to pack for different situations, but it seemed like a good way to try react-navigation. Looks a bit like this: ![](./img/travel-app.gif) Pictures are from Flickr. I figured out how to do that in [my Music App tutorial](https://school.shoutem.com/lectures/build-react-native-music-app-tutorial-part1/). Maybe I should make an opensource "show random pretty pic from Flickr" component. Seems useful ðŸ¤” Anyway, pics from Flickr, navigation done via `react-navigation`, lists of choices done by hand. No biggie thereâ€¦ still not sure how I'm going to get packing recommendations. I wonder how difficult it would be to add crowdsourcing to the appâ€¦ a bit of Firebase, some setup, a call or twoâ€¦ hmmmm. We'll see. Either way, expect an in-depth tutorial about all of this on [reactnative.school](reactnative.school) come Tuesday. Maybe Wednesday if I decide to wait for my new laptop to arrive. Really, the hardest part of today's livecoding was dealing with my computer. Damn thing is so slow when running OBS and [connecting to my DSLR](https://swizec.com/blog/connected-canon-dslr-webcam/swizec/7477) that it took 15 minutes to compile the initial blank app. And animations were slow in the iOS simulator and interaction was painful and I could barely type in the chatroom and even the Flickr images were taking way too long to show up. Just watch the stream video; it's painful as hell. Reminds me of playing Resident Evil on my 166MHz machine with 16MB RAM back in middle school. I'd read books during the door opening animations. These ones:  Yeah, that used to take 5 minutes on my computer in middle school :D Great game tho. Much fun. So yeah, fun livecoding, we made something pretty, then I ragequitted because I couldn't deal with my laptop anymore. Thank &lt;insert nerd deity> that I'm getting a new one in the mail this Wednesday. Then all will be better, right?
