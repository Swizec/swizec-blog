Here _we_ are, on a roadtrip of epic proportions ... or rather, as much as you can pack into ten days. This is the main event of the summer, the reason I borrowed [@smotko](http://twitter.com/smotko)'s car. The plan is to make it down to [Dubrovnik](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95 "Old City of Dubrovnik") - some 600km away from home - visit [Bruce Lee](http://www.bruceleefoundation.com/ "Bruce Lee")'s statue in [Mostar](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=43.3333333333,17.8&spn=0.1,0.1&q=43.3333333333,17.8 (Mostar)&t=h> "Mostar"), then go visit some Croatian islands for a few days of proper lounging around the beach like a pair of cows. Yesterday at ungodly hours in the morning the expedition was launched. So far the journey's included:

- hoards of cow-eyed tourists with their brain shut off, trying to take the single best picture of [Plitvice Lakes](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/98 "Plitvice Lakes National Park") ... no idea why they bothered, of course ours are going to be best.
- discovering [Croatia](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.8,16.0&spn=10.0,10.0&q=45.8,16.0 (Croatia)&t=h> "Croatia") is actually beautiful - but only inland [Dalmatia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia "Dalmatia"), the [flatland on the way to EXIT](http://swizec.com/blog/geek-at-a-music-festival-day-1/swizec/4825 "Geek at a music festival: Day 1") was weird and the coast is full of lazy cowstourists
- a scary old house without working electricity
- sleeping on the balcony of said house ... and later inside, with all the ghosts keeping us company
- hydroelectric power plant _inside a fucking mountain_
- one of the best looking longboarding roads ever ... with _maaaaaaybe_ just a bit too much traffic ... maybe, we'll see, I might have to sneak out while [@ponywithhiccups](http://twitter.com/ponywithhiccups) isn't looking
- huge wind tourbines! very huge!
- getting to know the interior of Car, very very well

Oh and we took some possibly good photos. Take a look, y'know, if you want to. I'm a blogpost not a cop. \[caption id="attachment_4909" align="alignnone" width="432" caption="Plitvice Lakes - where boats chase trains"][![Plitvice Lakes - where boats chase trains](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_20120726_183936.jpeg "Plitvice Lakes - where boats chase trains")](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-07-IMG_20120726_183936.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4910" align="alignnone" width="461" caption="Forestry!"][![Forestry!](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-07-IMG_1452-768x1024.jpg "Forestry!")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_1452.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4911" align="alignnone" width="461" caption="Jesus was a chump, this is how you do it"][![Jesus was a chump, this is how you do it](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-07-IMG_1438-768x1024.jpg "Jesus was a chump, this is how you do it")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_1438.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4912" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="The greenest green"][![The greenest green](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-07-photo-13-e1343393002368.jpg "The greenest green")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/photo-13.jpeg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4913" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="\*whisper\* I see dead trees"][![\*whisper\* I see dead trees](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-07-photo-23-1024x764.jpg "*whisper* I see dead trees")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/photo-23.jpeg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4914" align="alignnone" width="461" caption="Waterfalliness"][![Waterfalliness](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-07-IMG_1559-768x1024.jpg "Waterfalliness")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_1559.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4915" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="Down, down, down"][![Down, down, down](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-07-IMG_1565-1024x768.jpg "Down, down, down")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_1565.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4916" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="Roadtrip - the picture"][![Roadtrip - the picture](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-07-IMG_1646-1024x768.jpg "Roadtrip - the picture")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IMG_1646.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4917" align="alignnone" width="614" caption="View from the longboard road"][![View from the longboard road](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-07-photo-52-1024x764.jpg "View from the longboard road")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/photo-52.jpeg)\[/caption]
