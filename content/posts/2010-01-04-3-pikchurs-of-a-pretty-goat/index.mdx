While I was browsing through my blackberry a few moments ago to find a certain photo I stumbled upon some photos I took this Christmas.



They're of a very bloody cute small boy goat thing. My grandmother says this is as big as they get and by god the little rascals are awesome. Soon as I came into the barn this guy jumped on me and demanded petting!



PETTING!



A goat!!



:D



Here he is, now let's make him famous just because he's so cool.
