_This is a Livecoding Recap – an almost-weekly post about interesting things discovered while livecoding ?. Always under 500 words and with pictures. You can follow my channel, [here](https://liveedu.tv/swizec). New content almost **every Sunday at 2pm PDT**. There’s live chat, come say hai ?_  This Sunday, we built a zoomable pannable map with React and D3. We also added animation to our migration curves. Now people can see what they mean. \[caption id="attachment_7454" align="alignnone" width="1291"][![Click on the map to see a live example](./img/uk-migrations.gif)](https://swizec.github.io/migrations-map/) Click on the map to see a live example\[/caption] See? It zooms and it pans and the circles follow their curves. Just like the color, the amount of circles on each line signifies migration intensity. ? Here's how it works ?

## Animate SVG element to follow a curve

Moving an element along a line is one of those things you think you can figure out on your own but you can't. Then you see how it's done and you think, _"I'm dumb"_. But you're not dumb. It's totally un-obvious. We used Bostock's [Point-Along-Line Interpolation](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1705868) example as our model. It creates a custom tween that we apply to each circle as an `attrTween` transition.

    function translateAlong(path) {
        var l = path.getTotalLength();
        return function(d, i, a) {
            return function(t) {
                var p = path.getPointAtLength(t * l);
                return "translate(" + p.x + "," + p.y + ")";
            };
        };
    }

That's the custom tween. I'd love to explain how it works, but… well, we have a `getPointAtLength` function that SVG gives us by default on every `<path>` element. We use it to generate `translate(x, y)` strings that we feed into the `transform` attribute of a `<circle>` element. That part is obvious. The part I don't get is the 3-deep function nesting for currying. The top function returns a tween, I assume. It's a function that takes `d, i, a` as arguments and never uses them. Instead, it returns a time-parametrized function that returns a `translate(x, y)` string for each `t`. We know from D3 conventions that `t` runs in the `[0, 1]` interval, so we can assume the tween gives a _"point at t percent of full length of path"_ coordinates. Great. We apply it in our `MigrationLine` component like this:

    // inside MigrationLine
        _transform(circle, delay) {
            const { start } = this.props,
                  [ x1, y1 ] = start;

            d3.select(circle)
              .attr("transform", `translate(${x1}, ${y1})`)
              .transition()
              .delay(delay)
              .duration(this.duration)
              .attrTween("transform", translateAlong(this.refs.path))
              .on("end", () => {
                  if (this.state.keepAnimating) {
                      this._transform(circle, 0);
                  }
              });
        }
        
        componentDidMount() {
            const { Ncircles } = this.props;

            this.setState({
                keepAnimating: true
            });

            const delayDither = this.duration*Math.random(),
                  spread = this.duration/Ncircles;

            d3.range(delayDither, this.duration+delayDither, spread)
              .forEach((delay, i) =>
                  this._transform(this.refs[`circles-${i}`], delay)
              );
        }

We call `_transform` on every circle in our component. Each gets a different `delay` so that we get a roughly uniform distribution of circles on the line. Without this, they come in bursts, and it looks weird. `delayDither` ensures the circles for each line start with a random offset, which also helps fight the burstiness. Here's what the map looks like without `delayDither` and with a constant delay between circles regardless how many there are. ![](./img/bursty-map-1.gif) See? No good. You can see the [full MigrationLine code on Github](https://github.com/Swizec/migrations-map/blob/de8800aecca4484f8c5827a82c8a746127264143/src/MigrationLine.js).

## Zoom and pan a map

This part was both harder and easier than I thought. You see, D3 comes with something called [d3.zoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom). It does zooming _and_ panning. Cool, right? Should be easy to implement. And it is… if you don't fall down a rabbit hole. In the old days, the standard approach was to `.call()` zoom on an `<svg>` element, listen for `zoom` events, and adjust your scales. Zoom callback would tell you how to change zoominess and where to move, and you'd adjust your scales and re-render the visualization. We tried that approach with hilarious results: ![](./img/drag-1.gif) First, it was moving in the wrong direction, then it was jumping around. Changing the geo projection to achieve zoom and pan was _not_ the answer. Something was amiss. Turns out in D3v4, the zoom callback gets info to build an SVG transform. A `translate()` followed by a `scale()`. Apply those on the visualization and you get working zooming and panning! Of anything :D

    // in SVG rendering component
        onZoom() {
            this.setState({
                transform: d3.event.transform
            });
        }

        get transform() {
            if (this.state.transform) {
                const { x, y, k } = this.state.transform;
                return `translate(${x}, ${y}) scale(${k})`;
            }else{
                return null;
            }
        }
        // ...
        render() {
            return (
                
                    
                    // ...
        }

Get `d3.event.transform`, save it in `state` or a data store of some sort, re-render, use it on a `<g>` element that wraps everything. Voila, zooming and panning. ? \[caption id="attachment_7454" align="alignnone" width="1291"][![Click on the map to see a live example](./img/uk-migrations.gif)](https://swizec.github.io/migrations-map/) Click on the map to see a live example\[/caption] You can see the [full `World` component on Github](https://github.com/Swizec/migrations-map/blob/de8800aecca4484f8c5827a82c8a746127264143/src/Maps.js#L69). Happy hacking! ?
