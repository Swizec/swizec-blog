Over the weekend I started working on a [node.js client library for Toshl's new API](https://github.com/Swizec/toshl.js). An old side project stopped working recently and I need to fix it because life without [frequent emails about my money](http://swizec.com/blog/a-message-from-your-future-self/swizec/3377) is disorienting as hell. The [Toshl beta API](https://developer.toshl.com/) opened up in July is well thought out, has good documentation and provides everything you could possibly want. I love the well granulated permissions system. But for users of my node.js library I wanted to make life even simpler. Let's look at fetching expenses. After you authenticate - testing [OAuth](http://oauth.net "OAuth") clients sucks, and Toshl invalidates your token _very_ often. Think I had to refresh it four times in a five hour coding spree. - you can talk to `https://api.toshl.com/expenses` to get a list of expenses for the current user. This will return the last 30 entries. But there are a bunch of options. You have pagination, you can set specific `to` and `from` dates, you can filter things by tags and by not-tags. How can a library make this easy to use? One approach is to offer a way of specifying an options hash when calling a function, but can we make it even simpler? The answer lies in polymorphism. Let's say you have a function called `toshl.expenses`, in [Haskell](http://haskell.org "Haskell (programming language)") you could do something like this:

```
expenses::Result
expenses = general_expenses ""

expenses::Number -> Result
expenses N = general_expenses "?per_page="+str(N)

expenses::[String] -> Result
expenses tags = general_expenses "?tags="+(tags.join "&")

expenses::Date -> Date -> Result
expenses from to = general_expenses "?from="+str(from)+"&"+str(to)

expenses::Json -> Result
expenses params = general_expenses "?"+to_query(params)

general_expenses::String -> Result
general_expenses query = make_request "/expenses" query

make_request::String -> String -> Result
make_request endpoint query = ;; do stuff to read from full URL
```

The syntax is likely wrong but you get what I'm pointing at. You can always call `expenses` with the argument you care about and it will construct a call to the more generalized version of the function magically. You can tell what calling `expenses` will do in each case at a glance and checking what type of arguments the function accepts is trivial. Even somebody who isn't familiar with Haskell could understand that code. Here's that same polymorphic code in [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"). This time tested working code.

```
exports.Toshl.prototype.expenses = function (params, to, callback) {
    var options = {},
        query = '';
    callback = arguments[arguments.length-1];

    if (params) {
        if (typeof params == 'number') {
            options['per_page'] = params;
        }else if (arguments.length == 3) {
            options['from'] = util.iso_date(params);
            options['to'] = util.iso_date(to);
        }else if (params instanceof Array) {
            var tags = util.transform_tags(params);
            options[tags.type] = tags.tags;
        }else if (params instanceof Object) {
            options = params;

            ['from', 'to'].forEach(function (key) {
                if (options[key]) {
                    options[key] = util.iso_date(options[key]);
                }
            });
        }

        query = "?"+querystring.stringify(options);
    }

    this._request('/expenses'+query, callback);
};
```

Oh wow, what? Even if you're very comfortable with Javascript you're going to have a hard time figuring out what's going on. It seems the majority of the function deals with translating `arguments` into a `query`, then it defers to `this._request` for the hard work. This is the cleanest implementation I could think of so far. Let's investigate. First we ensured that `callback` is always the last supplied argument, that makes sense when you expect variable amounts of arguments. Everything from one to three is okay. Then, if `params` is a number we use it to construct a `?per_page=N` query. If there are three arguments, we use the first two to construct a `?from=Date&to=Date` query. If the first argument is an Array we use it to get tags and if it's an Object we assume it represents a parameters hash for the API. The result is that we can do this:

```
var toshl = new Toshl();

toshl.expenses(console.log); // prints last 30 expenses

toshl.expenses(5, console.log); // prints last 5 expenses

toshl.expenses("2013-10-01", new Date(), console.log); // prints all expenses between October 1st and now

toshl.expenses(["coffee", "food"], console.log); // prints last 30 expenses tagged with coffee or food

toshl.expenses({per_page: 10, tags: ["coffee", "food"]}, console.log) // prints last 10 expenses tagged coffee or food
```

The date magic is done with the wonderful [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) library - you can supply a Date object, a date string or a moment object, but we could obviously improve on this by assuming the `to` date is "now", if none is provided. But the code is getting complicated as it is. Does anyone know a better way to achieve polymorphism in Javascript? I really like it when I'm using libraries, but I hate implementing it this way ...
