The whole internets and all of media for that matter are abuzz with two words lately "Failing Economy". This I believe to be a paradox and since time is, still, money, let me sum it up for you:



**The global economy is failing for those afraid of change and opening oportunities for everybody else.**



In other words: all that's going on is a bit of spring cleaning, do not be alarmed.****
