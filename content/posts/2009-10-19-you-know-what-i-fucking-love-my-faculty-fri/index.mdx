Students will often get into debates concerning whether attending classes is worth it or not, more specifically, whether University (college for the brutes) actually gives you anything other than a shiny piece of paper to wipe your arse with and connections within the business.



More often than not the result of such debates is that yeah, classes aren't really worth your time, but all the studently benefits and said shiny paper are quite useful, if not downright mandatory for modern living. And so they continue going until they get so fed up with everything and how disconnected their learnings are from the real world.



Personally I must admit that until very recently I've always been one to conclude that university is my lovely redundancy plan and fuck it all, I'm just there for the student status and the shiny paper!



And then something happened last week, or the week before, hard to say. I suddenly realised that this inclination of mine didn't have **anything** to do with the university, faculty and classes themselves, but rather had _everything_ to do with what I was wasting my time on.



See, I was spending most of my days on semi-trivial algorithmical problems, most of what I was doing boiled down to coding-fu and how good a [coder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer "Programmer") I was. Yes, naturally, I thought of myself as a programmer and believed to be master of the universe, knower of all.

But apparently, the harder the problems you're facing at work are, the more classes make sense and seem useful! For fuck's sake, I've even found a real world applicable use for the bloody [linear algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") that was fucking with my head a month ago! Seriously! And I know jack shit because I still haven't fucking passed.



Let us sum this up before it devolves into a bunch of swear words and obvious revelations that are obvious to everyone but me:
