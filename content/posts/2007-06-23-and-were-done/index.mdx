Well yesterday was the last day of A-levels making it the final day of having to even remotely worry about something high school related. Sure I still have to wait for the results, but that doesn't trouble me much because all I need to be accepted into my chosen university is a pass. My gut tells me I'll get heaps more than just a pass, we'll see.

In the meantime [here](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XngQJzAmVm8) are [some](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=4luRhIxvAX8) [high](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=n3g5MKeqBwI) [speed](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=66qZq_8eP20) [water](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=WWjRzy-pTsE) balloon videos. Quite amazingly awesome, wish my eyes could do high speed.
