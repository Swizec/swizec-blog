People have been asking how I sidehustle, what makes it work, and whether when the sums are up, if it's worth the time. Would I not be better off just getting a better paying job?



If that job was as a fancy pants senior engineer at Facebook… probably, yeah. But what's the fun in that? 3 hours commuting every day.



So here's the breakdown for February 2017 ?

This has been an expensive month. ? I've decided to go hard on video, and I wasn't happy with the quality. You can see a big improvement just with studio lighting.
