Hello anyone subscribed via a feed reader. This isn't a real post, just a quick note to all of you who have been complaining about repeated posts. Over the past week or so I moved my feed over to feedburner. While doing that things went wrong and I spammed all of you with a few tens of repeated posts. Oops. Then two days ago I finally figured out how to convince feedburner to use a full feed instead of excerpts. This lead to more spamming and I'm told some people are now receiving each post twice. If you're one of the people having issues, I suggest you replace your subscriptions with this link: <http://feeds.feedburner.com/AGeekWithAHat2> That is the direct real feed now so hopefully there won't be any problems :)
