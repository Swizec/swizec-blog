So I was thinking, for the longest of times I've been wanting to do a whole bunch of things ... ... and I never quite get around to doing them. Fuck. This. Shit. This year, I make a list and I fucking clear it by the time I'm 30. There is no sense in living if you aren't having way over the top fun with it. Also making a list, publicly posting it and putting a deadline on it is a sure fire way to have a really really really really crappy 30th birthday when you inevitably realise that you've done way too few of these things and have just run out of soup.

1. [Bungee jump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping "Bungee jumping")
2. Canyoning
3. Solo sky dive from plane
4. [BASE jump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASE_jumping "BASE jumping") the fjords
5. Flying suit BASE jump the fjords
6. Jump off a few other things with a flying suit
7. Climb Triglav
8. Climb Everest
9. Drive at least one official european [rally race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallying "Rallying")
10. Drive and finish the desert oldsmobile rally (I keep forgetting the name)
11. Ride the trans-siberian railway
12. Learn to do a no handed endo
13. Perform a [double tailwhip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailwhip "Tailwhip") with a mountain bike
14. Come to a board meeting with a parachute through the window

Noticed a pattern? :P Well I've got 8 (although I like to pretend it's 9) years to do all of this. Will happily take suggestions for things I haven't thought of. EDIT: Oh and 15: Learn to ride a unicycle
