Last time I played around with [Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/ "Appcelerator Titanium") I didn't get a chance to [really put it through its paces](http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-11-8/swizec/2150). Mostly because I wasn't getting anywhere ... I remember spending hours, even days, just figuring out how to get a [Hello World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program "Hello world program") to run in a simulator. \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="240" caption="Image by Podknox via Flickr"][![MoBods Scoop!

Development ;-)")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/91198056@N00/5638371774)\[/caption]Yesterday was my lucky day! Not only did I get something to run, I actually made something useful. Or rather, I was given a working app and told to add some features and generally make it better a tiny little bit. Took me way too long - expected when dealing with technology you know _nothing_ about - but at 6am today I had [Pickup](http://www.pickup.io/) connecting to the server on the user's own private channel and talking nicely to the [Chrome extension](http://googlevoiceblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-google-voice-extension-for-chrome.html "Chrome extension"). By the way this isn't my project, I just helped out, but from what I saw last night, you _want_ to sign up for the beta. Promise!

## Titanium good

1. It's [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"), if you haven't noticed I _love_ javascript
2. The same app works both on android and [iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios "IOS")
3. Titanium API's are generally simpler than what I've seen of native iOS
4. Properly using the [user interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") API's gives you a native look&feel

## Titanium bad

1. The [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment"); I don't like being forced to use an IDE and I very much hate being forced to use a _crappy_ IDE.
2. Everything looks like it would be pretty much impossible to develop with my usual [text editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor") method
3. Code once, run everywhere is good in principle, but it usually ends up lacking the polish of a real native app, especially since android and iOS have slightly different [UI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") guidelines and traditions

## Conclusion

All in all, there's a lot of potential in this Titanium stuff despite the shortcomings. I might just start adding a mobile part to my future projects ... there's certainly some that could use it.
