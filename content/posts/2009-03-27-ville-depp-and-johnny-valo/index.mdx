Last night while I was watching this lovely music video that someone has decided to call Summer Wine by [Ville Valo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ville_Valo "Ville Valo") and [Natalia Avelon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalia_Avelon "Natalia Avelon") a striking change in Ville's appeareance hit the retina of my optical receptors. Suddenly, as if from the moustache and the beard, he stopped looking like a dashing woman that I used to know him as. Let me find a photograph to offer as evidence ...

He looks like he's turned into a [Johnny Depp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp "Johnny Depp") clone, so I've decided to henceforth talk of Ville as Ville Depp and because the original likewise looks strikingly similar to the fake I have decided to refer to mister Johnny as a Johnny Valo, but you know what, let me give you anexamples of the striking new similarity.

Now I understand that none of this could be any sort of reference to reality anymore since that song is from 2007, but fuck it, it's all news to me and those other poor sobs who don't get out of their basements much.



For the female reader, here is some more Johnny:
