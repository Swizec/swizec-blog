\[caption id="" align="alignright" width="336" caption="A cute hedgehog"][![A cute hedgehog](./img/NeGxI.png "A cute hedgehog")](http://thecuteoftheday.tumblr.com/post/23988752978/via-my-friend-decided-to-give-her-hedgehog-a)\[/caption] Next week is going to be rather busy. Three (possibly four) exams and giving a short talk ... that needs to be prepared, delivered and the resulting lady fans wooed. You know how it goes. I don't want to go into radio silence for a whole week. Writing crappy quickies all week is severely undesirable as well. SO, if you've got _anything_ to say, anything at all, say it here. Write a guest post for this site on anything ranging from science, to tea and the startup world. I'm not particularly picky, but I want to feel a human voice (as opposed to a generic marketing post spam) Why would you do that? Because:

1.  You shall win my eternal gratitude. I will owe you **two** not one (favour, blogpost, whatever)
2.  Your post will land in ~800 adoring RSS readers
3.  I'm going to tweet your post exactly three times. That gets a reader or two
4.  I will lovingly spoon feed your post to all 1700 of my G+ humans
5.  Did I mention I'm going to love you forever?

If that isn't enough to convince you, I have attached a cute hedgehog. You can't say no to something _that_ cute. Fact.
