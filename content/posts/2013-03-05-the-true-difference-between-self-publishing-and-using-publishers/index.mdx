Right now I'm writing two books at once and yes that was a _terrible_ idea. Please avoid doing this if you at all can.



One book I'm working on with a [publisher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing "Publishing"), the other I'm [self-publishing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-publishing "Self-publishing"). Both are interesting processes, but I have noticed one colossal difference between the two:



Self-publishing -> November 2012 to March 2013 (5 months) -> 104 hours worked. Includes researching, writing, marketing, everything. About 40 pages written.



Publisher -> late January 2013 to March 2013 (1.5 months) -> 101 hours worked. Just researching and writing. About 100 pages written.



Might be the tight chapter deadlines I keep missing, might be the nice project coordinator lady asking me what the fuck do I think I'm doing via email every couple of weeks.



But them's the facts. I get more writing done when working with a publisher.
