For a while now I've been meaning to write a list of services that I need or want, but haven't found. Some of these probably don't exist, some of them just haven't reached my radar. \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="306" caption="Good Dickens! It's a Wenlock! via miksago"][![Good Dickens! It's a Wenlock! via miksago](http://distilleryimage11.s3.amazonaws.com/1ae7a724f0c211e1b55e22000a1e9610_6.jpg "Good Dickens! It's a Wenlock! via miksago")](http://instagr.am/p/O22WTQn0AX/)\[/caption] You can read this list as a sort of manifesto of what I'll get up to in the next few years. Feel free to scavenge for ideas as well. I won't mind, in fact I'll be glad because there's more ideas here than one guy can implement :) In no particular order:

-   A dashboard for the data I collect about myself either implicitly or explicitly
-   A way to consolidate my social profile - at least change the avatar everywhere at once
-   Some way to keep track of all the profiles I have
-   Stripe for Europe
-   When I write, dynamically predict how satisfied my audience will be so I can adjust accordingly
-   Ability to test different contents of a blogpost in regards to different audiences
-   Tell my users how long they are likely to take reading a story
-   Give me N pieces of news/content that will take X amount of time
-   Send funny pictures to friends offline with a single click _\[I am SO rebooting this one]_
-   Pay for small favours by _actually_ sending a cookie across the world
-   A tool that reminds me to keep in touch with potential clients (some sort of [CRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management "Customer relationship management") I guess)
-   According to my personal metrics - give me progress [predictions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction "Prediction") with graphs and advice on improving
-   A helper for building good habits so I can just respond to events rather than use my own willpower
-   Unified way of dealing with all the apps/services that have my CreditCard or [PayPal](http://paypal.com "PayPal") info
-   Unified directory of everyone with [OAuth](http://oauth.net "OAuth") access to any of my accounts
-   Remind me to unfollow/unfriend people before the task gets too daunting
-   Some unified way of dealing with all the services I might need like plumbers, sysadmins and food delivery
-   Remind me to eat according to a schedule
-   Create a diet for me _and_ make sure the ingredients are always in the fridge

While nothing revolutionary, this is a list of projects that deal with the fact that I'm almost as lazy as I am forgetful. Most of all, the proposed services are about _predicting_ rather than reacting. I don't want to react to a problem, I want to predict I'm going to have a problem **while I still have time to fix it!** With the piles of data available, computers are better at making these predictions than I am. ![Machine Learning](./img/machinelearning.png "Machine Learning")
