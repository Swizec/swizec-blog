The Internet talks a lot about article extraction - taking a page and deciding what the real content is. Hell, I've written about the [Uncanny valley of web scraping](http://www.zemanta.com/fruitblog/the-uncanny-valley-of-web-scraping/) myself.



Article extraction is such a wide spread problem that a bunch of API's exist to help you solve it. Everything from a fringe feature in five or ten semantic API's, to startups devoted wholly to extracting articles - like Diffbot.



But what if you don't want to extract an article? What if all you want is: _this is the header, here is a sidebar, these are ads, here is content, oh and this is a footer, btw those are comments._

Suddenly you are shit out of luck.



Sure, it makes sense the API's wouldn't let you do this - it's supposedly their secret magic sauce. Right?



Except it isn't.



Analyzing the different implementations of article extractors reveals that far from using a methodical approach of marking up different bits of a page, they mostly work as tree [pruning algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_%28decision_trees%29 "Pruning (decision trees)") - go through [DOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model"), remove anything that's not promising, end up with the juicy article.



Nothing you could use to create a web page segmentor ...



Turns out, there is but a single very useful paper devoted to web page segmentation - Christian Kohlschütter's _[A Densitometric Approach to Web Page Segmentation](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoitweb.uncc.edu%2F~jfan%2Fwebimage2.pdf)._



Yep, the same guy who later wrote _Boilerplate Detection using Shallow Text Features,_which later turned into [Boilerpipe](https://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/), one of the best (most certainly the quickest) libraries web content extraction.



In the paper Kohlschütter explains that only three approaches exist:

- segmenting visually
- linguistic approach
- densitometric approach

Visual segmentation is perhaps the easiest to understand - you _look_ at a website and as a person you instantly know where different sections are. A computer vision algorithm could do something similar. With the caveat you now have to render every page, then run a [visual learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_learning "Visual learning") algorithm and do a bunch of things that are computationally very expensive.



The linguistic approach is somewhat more reasonable - take a page, look at distributions of words and syllables and what have you ([quanititive linguistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_linguistics) this is called) and decide based on that. Problem here is, this only works well for large blocks of text ... the linguistic content in, say, a header might be somewhat lacking.

## Block fusion algorithm

Kohlschütter's densitometric approach has a tendency to work as well as a visual algorithm, while being as fast as a lingustic approach ... bloody marvelous!



The idea is basically this:

- walk through nodes
- assign a text density to each node -> number-of-tokens / number-of-'lines'
- merge neighbor nodes with the same densities
- repeat until desired granularity is reached

The simplicity of this algorithm is just brilliant. Even better is the fact they managed to get it down to _15ms_ per page on average. For comparison's sake - the time it takes Readability to clean up a page is counted in seconds, an average response time from Diffbot (visual approach) is about _10 seconds per page._



Yep, that fast.



And for the icing on the cake - most main bits of the Block Fusion Algorithm are already implemented deep inside the bowels of Boilerpipe. You just have to look hard enough.
