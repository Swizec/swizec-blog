_Wake up! Wake up, we're gonna be late!_ \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="342" caption="Planica"]![Planica](./img/fa00e838704a11e18bb812313804a181_72.jpg "Planica")\[/caption] 5am. Took my sister to [Planica](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.4983333333,13.7391666667&spn=0.1,0.1&q=46.4983333333,13.7391666667 (Planica)&t=h> "Planica") to watch a bunch of [flying squirrel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_squirrel "Flying squirrel") men throw themselves off a big hill with long sticks attached to their feet to see who can go the farthest. All the while suffering a bunch of loud drunkish people. At least that's what I thought ... but all in all it was actually pretty damn awesome! The two free tickets didn't just get us in the event place, after some careful maneuvering by The Ticket Guy we also got into the VIP section, right under the landing spot, with a good view of the whole flight. Then the VIP section turned into the [VIP seats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Important_Person "Very Important Person"), the ones closest to all the action. Then it became a trip up the hill to see everything _very_ up close. Even the judge's house thingy. I will never forget the eery calm of standing right next to the slope and having a guy _fall_ past you, into nothing, seemingly laying on air. Subtle whoosh sound. Amazing. And the speed on the take off ramp! Wow! TV doesn't do it justice _at all_. Yeah, sure, he's doing 104km/h, so what? But when you're standing 10 meters away ... damn. Those guys are wearing underpants with a lot more room than mine have ... Seeing [Robert Kranjec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kranjec "Robert Kranjec") jump a 231m was ... impressive. The landing looks much harder in real life than it does on the telly. Alas, the [iPhone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone "IPhone") camera was too slow to catch anyone in the air. \[caption id="attachment_4000" align="alignnone" width="717" caption="Looking up from down below"][![Looking up from down below](./img/photo-3-1024x764.jpg "Looking up from down below")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-3.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_3998" align="alignnone" width="717" caption="A bad crowd shot"][![A bad crowd shot](./img/photo-1-1024x764.jpg "A bad crowd shot")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-1.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_3997" align="alignnone" width="535" caption="There was a guy in a full deer suit"][![There was a guy in a full deer suit](./img/photo-764x1024.jpg "There was a guy in a full deer suit")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_3999" align="alignnone" width="717" caption="Plenty of balloons behind the VIP area"][![Plenty of balloons behind the VIP area](./img/photo-2-1024x764.jpg "Plenty of balloons behind the VIP area")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-2.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4002" align="alignnone" width="535" caption="Ski lifts are weird without snow"][![Ski lifts are weird without snow](./img/photo-5-764x1024.jpg "Ski lifts are weird without snow")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-5.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4001" align="alignnone" width="535" caption="Planica's baby sibling"][![Planica's baby sibling](./img/photo-4-764x1024.jpg "Planica's baby sibling")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-4.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4003" align="alignnone" width="535" caption="The crowd below"][![The crowd below](./img/photo-6-764x1024.jpg "The crowd below")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-6.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4005" align="alignnone" width="535" caption="Whoosh, gone"][![Whoosh, gone](./img/photo-8-764x1024.jpg "Whoosh, gone")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-8.jpg)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_4004" align="alignnone" width="535" caption="Best seats?"][![Best seats?](./img/photo-7-764x1024.jpg "Best seats?")](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/photo-7.jpg)\[/caption]
