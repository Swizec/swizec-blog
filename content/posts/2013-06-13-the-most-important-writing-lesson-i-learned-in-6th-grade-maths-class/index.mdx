\[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]![My elementary school](./img/0H71ZANRNWT3G7eWWJId "My elementary school") My elementary school\[/caption] _"What is a square?"_, my maths teacher would ask. _"A square has four equal sides at right angles and its surface area is a\*a"_, a pupil would answer. Happy they got all the facts right. _"But what **is** a square? Those are just its properties."_ _"Errr ... a square is a ... shape? ... that has four equal sides at right angles?"_ _"That's right. A square is a shape, the rest are just properties."_ Every single one of us got that wrong. Every single time. Didn't matter if you were a straight A pupil or barely scraping by, everyone forgot to _answer the question_. The story repeated itself a year later with geometric objects. If there's one important lesson about writing I ever learned, it's that _a square is a shape_.
