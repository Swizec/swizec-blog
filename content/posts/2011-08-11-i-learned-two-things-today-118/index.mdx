Today I learned that old movies are even better when you watch them in a proper vintage theatre. Went to [Stanford Theatre](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.44507,-122.1627&spn=0.01,0.01&q=37.44507,-122.1627 (Stanford%20Theatre)&t=h> "Stanford Theatre") to watch [Audrey Hepburn](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/audrey_hepburn "Audrey Hepburn")'s [Roman Holiday](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/roman_holiday "Roman Holiday") and it was quite possibly the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. There's just something special about going to a place where they still put up the schedule above the front door like you sometimes see in "old" movies ... then again, a lot of places around here still seem to do that. And I really loved the fact that even though this was a [romantic comedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy_film "Romantic comedy film") it didn't have one of those gushy sugary endings where the main characters end up living happily ever after. There was closure, yes, but a happy ending ... guess it depends on how you look at it. Another thing that I learned today is that [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/ "Appcelerator Titanium") is pretty cool technology. Haven't managed to play too much with it because I was struggling with the [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment") they shove down your throat when you're starting out, but it looks like it might add a whole new possible dimension to what I can do with [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript"). But I guess we'll see tomorrow when I start to really play around with the thing.
