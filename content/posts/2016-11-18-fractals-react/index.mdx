So… this started as an article about why recursion doesn't work in React. [It _looks_ like it works](https://swizec.com/blog/simple-mobx-driven-modals/swizec/7166), then you `npm run build`, and it stops working. Curious, right? Worth looking into, eh? That's not the article you're getting. It _started_ as that article, then I spent 3 hours building a Pythagoras tree fractal. It's 2:30am, and is my life even real? Who the hell accidentally spends all night building fractals? Me… I guess. ![](./img/growing-pythagoras-tree.gif) Pretty, innit? Built with React, and it's going to stop working when I `npm run build`. Still don't know why. I'll figure _that_ out next week. Here's how the [Pythagoras tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_(fractal)) works:

> The construction of the Pythagoras tree begins with a square. Upon this square are constructed two squares, each scaled down by a linear factor of ½√2, such that the corners of the squares coincide pairwise. The same procedure is then applied recursively to the two smaller squares, ad infinitum.

? That becomes four bullet points:

-   1 component called `<Pythagoras >`
-   draws rectangle
-   calculates props for next 2 rectangles
-   `<Pythagoras><Pythagoras>`

Which turns into some 30 lines of code:

    import React from 'react';
    import { interpolateViridis } from 'd3-scale';

    const Factor = .5*Math.sqrt(2);

    const Pythagoras = ({ maxlvl, w, x, y, lvl, left, right }) => {
        if (lvl > maxlvl || w < 1) {
            return null;
        }

        const nextLeft = Factor*w,
              nextRight = Factor*w,
              d = nextLeft + nextRight + w,
              A = 45,
              B = 45;

        let rotate = '';

        if (left) {
            rotate = `rotate(${-A} 0 ${w})`;
        }else if (right) {
            rotate = `rotate(${B} ${w} ${w})`;
        }

        return (
            
                

                

                
            
        );
    };


    export default Pythagoras;

Beautiful. Let me explain. `interpolateViridis` is a [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) that gives beautiful colors. Call it with an argument in `[0, 1]` and it returns a color. `Factor` is the constant linear factor. We use it to calculate the sides of future rectangles. `d` is the diameter of the triangle formed by the current square and two future squares. More on that later. `A` and `B` are angles for each future rectangle. Set to 45 degrees statically.

## Then we start drawing.

If we're in a `left` rectangle, we set up a left rotation; if `right` then a right rotation. `rotate()` is an SVG transformation that rotates the current coordinate system. To draw the rectangle, we:

-   `translate` to `(x, y`), that means "move there"
-   add the rotation
-   now our coordinate system is moved and rotate
-   draw a rectangle at `(0, 0)`
-   add two `<Pythagoras>` with new parameters

And that's how you build a fractal in React. It won't work in production, but it sure looks pretty on your localhost. ![](./img/growing-pythagoras-tree-1.gif) The animation is done in [App.js](https://github.com/Swizec/react-fractals/blob/master/src/App.js) with a timer that updates the `maxlvl` prop every 500ms. Calling the root node of `Pythagoras` looks like this:

       

Start `lvl` at `0` and set the `maxlvl`. Those are important. At `maxlvl` past 12 or 13, it stops working. It takes too much CPU power to ever render. Yes, I tried. The naive algorithm isn't good enough. You could optimize by taking calculations out of recursion and preparing them in advance.

## The part I can't figure out

Look at [Andrew Hoyer's](http://andrew-hoyer.com/experiments/fractals/) Pythagoras tree. That thing is beautiful and flexible and dances like tree-shaped worm. ![](./img/andrew-hoyer-tree.gif) ? I can't figure out how to calculate those angles and rectangle sizes. I know that using `.5` in the `Factor` is for `45` degree angles. You can change the ratio by using a `.3` and `.7` factor for each side. Then it stops working with `45` degree angles yeah. ![](./img/broken-tree.gif) Ok, that was expected. Since you know all the sides, you should be able to apply the [Law of Sines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines) to calculate the angle.

     const nextLeft = .3*Factor*w,
              nextRight = .7*Factor*w,
              d = nextLeft + nextRight + w,
              A = Math.degrees(Math.asin(nextRight/d)),
              B = Math.degrees(Math.asin(nextLeft/d));

![](./img/broken-tree2.gif) I can't figure it out. I'm pretty sure I'm applying the Law of Sines correctly, but the numbers it throws out are wrong. Halp ? PS: Here's a paper that describes [using Pythagoras trees as data structures](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/08dd/831514db573cb9fd2b993a5814007888117a.pdf). Sort of.
