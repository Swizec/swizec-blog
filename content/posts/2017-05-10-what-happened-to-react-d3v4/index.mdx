In December or November last year, I made a string of big promises. I'm gonna have the [all new version of React+D3v4](https://gum.co/mTWg) ready by Christmas, it's gonna be amazing, there's an interactive video course coming in January or February, and a brand new D3v4 cheatsheet. All the things!



It is now May.



All I've achieved is that I pissed off my girlfriend. Working over Christmas was a dumb idea, and I'm dumb for having thought of it.



Book… good progress, valiant effort, still not done. I have all the new examples and projects. I've finished all the theoretical parts and the big fat practical part. I've done the animation bits as well.



Interactive course and videos… haven't even started. Gotta finish the source book first!



Here's what happened:



In November, I started talking with Shoutem, and we came up with [React Native School](http://reactnative.school). Originally my plan was to finish React+D3v4, leave a month of buffer to recuperate, then dive into building a new React Native app every two weeks for React Native School.



That did not quite work out. But I still had to start React Native articles in February. That's [been going pretty well](http://reactnative.school). New app almost every two weeks, the trip to Europe messed up my schedule a bit, but I'm getting back into it.



Because of the increased workload though, I haven't been able to work on the book as much. Or at all, really.



**BUT** on my flight back from Europe, I was able to touch up and fix the Redux animation particles example. It's shiny and useful and fits React 15.5.x now.



Then over the last week of jetlag early mornings, I kept writing and writing, and now the canvas section is done. A whole brand new section on using HTML5 Canvas to build declarative bitmaps and making your animations speedy.



Even finished the first React + Canvas example. The particle generator pushed to 20,000 elements. It's great.



So here's the deal: By the end of this month, I'll have the book fully finished. The missing parts are:



- [n-body collision simulation with D3, MobX, and Canvas](https://swizec.com/blog/n-body-collision-simulation-react-d3-mobx/swizec/7497) example
- [Dancing tree fractal](https://swizec.com/blog/dancing-tree-fractal-react/swizec/7288) and comparison of React alternatives
- some tips on performance



That's it. That's all I have to write to finish the book. I can totally do that in the next 3 weeks even while doing React Native School. Especially because the two big chapters already exist as blog posts. That makes it easier.



Wish me luck.
