On Monday I went to a little place called Prebold in order to see one of the early performances of the band called Azone. I'm told it's the first with this lineup ... after just five rehersals. Good on them I guess.

The band claims their playing was terrible, that it was slow, full of mistakes and downright rotten. But I guess that's for them to know, personally I found it enjoyable and really good. Maybe because I've not heard their playing properly? Who could tell really.
