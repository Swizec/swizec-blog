[The Kissybook](http://kissybook.net) is a colaborative art project that seems like a really cool idea, which is why I drew this [cute little bunny](http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/49689143/) in hopes of being included in the book. We'll see how it goes, I'll be sure to buy a copy, or a few, if I get in.
