As is often the case, I saw a news item that "shook the nation" only about three days post facto and as is also \[too] often the case, it was about a horrendous [vehicular collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_accident "Car accident") that nipped a few young lives in the bud.



What exactly happened isn't all that \\important - a [drunk driver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk_driving_%28United_States%29 "Drunk driving (United States)") was driving against traffic on a highway and eventually caused a crash. People are dead, cars are mutilated, the press had a new bone to chew for a few days. Nothing new here.
