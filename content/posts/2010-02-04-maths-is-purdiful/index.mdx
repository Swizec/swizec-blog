This whole week I've been doing a lot of maths studying. Things like [parametric curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation "Parametric equation"), LaGrange theorems and funky functional sequences.



Naturally I've developed a bit of a love for pretty mathematical objects, so I wanted to share some with you.



1\. Our first contestant is the [cardioid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid "Cardioid"). She's a bit chubby on the sides but has a heart of gold.



[![Cardioid](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2010-02-Screen-shot-2010-02-04-at-6.09.19-PM.png "Cardioid")](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+r+%3D+1-cosPhi+for+Phi+in+0,2Pi)



2\. The second contestant is an implicit heart and was contributed by a bloke on Facebook whom I believe has had this saved somewhere because it would be just mindblowing if he even know it from heart, let alone could create it.



[![Implicit heart](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2010-02-Screen-shot-2010-02-04-at-6.11.36-PM.png "Implicit heart")](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+(x2+%2B+y2+-+1)3+-+x2+*+y3+%3D+0)



3\. This little nugget followed from my experimentation with parameters of a curve I don't know the name of ... it's a flower if you haven't noticed.



[![Flower](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2010-02-Screen-shot-2010-02-04-at-6.13.41-PM.png "Flower")](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+r+%3D+cos(12Phi)+for+Phi+in+0,2Pi)



4\. The Butterfly Curve is well known in some circles, but I found it by stumbling around wikipedia like a drunken madman



[![Butterfly Curve](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2010-02-Screen-shot-2010-02-04-at-6.15.31-PM.png "Butterfly Curve")](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+r%3De(sin(Phi))-2*cos(4(Phi))%2Bsin((2*Phi-Pi)/24)5+for+Phi+in+0,20Pi)



5\. There are likely to be other contestants I have yet to discover.



So, which curve do you think is the most beautifulest mathematical construct?
