_This is a Livecoding Recap – an almost-weekly post about interesting things discovered while livecoding ?. Always under 500 words and with pictures. You can follow my channel [here](https://livecoding.tv/swizec). New content almost **every Sunday at 2pm Pacific**. There’s live chat, come say hai ?_ In an unprecedented move, this weekend I livecoded twice. There was much to do.   No livecoding for the third session. Girlfriends and birds need sleep, and my office has no door. Silly, I know. What kind of office doesn't have a door? ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯ The first session revolved around two things:

-   Wait, what's in the Bundle again?
-   I can't design, but maybe I can find a good thing on Themeforest.

The second session was all about:

-   Aaaaaah My old React framework for landing pages doesn't work with this theme I bought and this theme is being confusing and I don't know how turn bits of it into React components aaaaaah!

![](./img/FpcN8fN.gif) I'm not going to spell out the first section here just yet. The bundle is going to be amazing, and if you want to see what it's _probably_ going to contain, watch the video. Hopefully I get final confirmation from the other authors soon ? There are going to be 3 tiers again, just like last year: Basic, Epic, Majestic. I wanted to do two tiers, but Stephen is a machine, and we have too much amazing stuff to offer. Pricing just didn't make sense with two tiers. Alas. Basic might be a bit pricey right now. Is $89 too much for the basic offering if full value is $149? ?

This year's page is built around the _"Why we ❤️ React"_ theme. Last year, it was all about "Take the leap, learn React, it's cool, we promise" and about making more money and building shit faster. That worked great in 2015, but I think that in 2016, everyone already knows a lot of this. So I wanted to make it more community focused. Promote the React love, let others talk about why it's great, then offer a helping hand in learning. Thoughts? ![](./img/7ztmthi.png) I'm hoping to convince the other authors - Stephen, Andrzej, Juho, Azat - to make a 10- or 20-second selfie video saying why they love React. That would work marvelously on the page, I think. Last time someone asked me for a video testimonial, it took 5 weeks to muster the courage. We'll see how that works. Cyber Monday is around the corner :D Hmmm ... technical stuff ? Honestly, there isn't that much technical stuff that goes into slapping together a landing page. It follows this pattern:

-   Look at bought theme
-   Oooh, I like this widget!
-   Inspect source
-   Copy-pasta source as React component
-   Repeat until done

Labour intensive at first, but gets quicker and quicker. For example, I can now make dark sections with top or bottom decoration like this:

    <DarkSection hasTop="rightSlope"
                 hasBottom="zigZag">
        <Content.WhyPain />
    </DarkSection>

Neat. You can see the [source on github](https://github.com/Swizec/new-react-bundle-page). Thanks to the audience for helping with the pricing and picking a theme. You guys rock :)
