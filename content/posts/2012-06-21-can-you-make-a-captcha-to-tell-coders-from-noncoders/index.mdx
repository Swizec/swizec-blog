Let's say you want to launch a service. For coders, by coders.



\[caption id="" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Coder decoder group AN/MSQ-18 (Photo credit: Wikipedia)"][![English: Coder decoder group AN/MSQ-18 (ao in ...](./img/wikipedia-commons-thumb-9-9a-AN-MSQ-18_Coder_Decoder_Group.png-300px-AN-MSQ-18_Coder_Decoder_Group.png "English: Coder decoder group AN/MSQ-18 (ao in ...")](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AN-MSQ-18_Coder_Decoder_Group.png)\[/caption]



Let's also say you want _only_ coders. Nobody else should be able to get in.



Leaving aside any "_Haha, launching is \_hard\_! Allow everyone and tweak incentives so only coders want to join."_ While essentially true, coders act differently around coders than they do around people, and an exclusive environment could be awesome.

## How do you make a lock only coders can get through?

The low-tech solution is a manual approval process. When a person signs up, you look at their profile and google around a little bit. Try to find them on Github, see if they have any technical blogs, have ever released a piece of software etc.



Congratulations! You've just made yourself a bunch of work and excluded the 80% of the coders who don't have a strong web presence or aren't even interested in that sort of thing.



No, we need an automated test ... something only coders can solve, but trumps everyone else.



Something that:

- **Every** [coder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer "Programmer") can solve.
- Nobody who _isn't_ a coder can solve.
- Is simple to test.
- Takes less than 15 seconds to solve.

But what's the common knowledge all coders share?



**The [for-loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop "For loop")!**



Everyone can write a for loop right!? How do you test a for loop? [Wikia:code lists _18_ different for loops](http://code.wikia.com/wiki/For_loop). Which means there are more ... plus there's languages like Haskell which prefer recursio. I hear there's also a lot of coders out there using [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets") and HTML that don't even have a concept for looping.



Yes, those people are coders too. They write thousands of lines of code. Maybe not programmers - definitely coders.



Okay that was a stupid idea ... but every coder has got a favourite text editor don't they? If you like a text editor you are definitely a coder. Then again, there are thousands of [text editors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor") out there, we can't test this one either.



Oh hey! Everyone can write a [regular expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression "Regular expression") can't they? At least a very basic one!



Regular expressions are great, they aren't language specific since they _are_ a language and pretty much everyone has written a basic regular expression once or twice in some of their projects.



Well, except for the guys writing hardcore C all their lives who are coding rocket launch procedures for [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/ "SpaceX"). Doubt they ever needed a regex. Maybe for _grep_ or _sed_?

## A plausible solution

A friend of mine recently (yesterday) had this problem and it seems the final solution is good enough for now.



To sign up you need to answer one of two questions:

1. Write a _very_ simple regex. (match _New York_ and _New Jersey,_ but not _Newark_)
2. Or find a hidden element on the webpage and click it.

I was too lazy to do either, so I went into the page source and used node.js to run the snippet of javascript that constructs the redirect url. _Also_ proving that I am a coder. I think ...



But what about all those coders who are just starting out? Who haven't encountered any of this stuff before? It took me _years_ to first get into regexes ... And what of those who've _never_ come into contact with either regexes _or_front-end web development ... someone coding up controllers for your car's engine, say?



Question is, how would _you_ make a [CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA "CAPTCHA") to distinguish coders from non-coders?
