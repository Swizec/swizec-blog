Initially I wanted to write this as a comment to [TwiTip.com's Twitter goals post](http://www.twitip.com/defining-twitter-goals-a-tip-for-successful-use-of-twitter/), but it grew and grew and felt more like a blogpost of its own.

I use twitter to be a popular twitterer. That's the only goal I really have.  
  
But there are hidden goals of course. Like just \_what\_ comes from being a powerful twitterer? Well there's the personal branding thing, everyone's doing it right now and it's useful for a number of things pretty much everyone knows. Another thing powerful twitterers have is an instant readerbase, have a new project? Announce it on twitter and instantly hundreds of people know about it ... that's a very powerful promotion tool.  
  
Last but not least, is the knowledge aspect of being a powerful twitterer. You find out many things, very many things you find out near instantly and a lot of that information is in fact very good, useful information. The old saying goes "Valuable information is only valuable while it's fresh". Ding ding.  
  
So yeah, twitter goals, I say don't go overboard, just go out there and have fun. The rest will follow.
