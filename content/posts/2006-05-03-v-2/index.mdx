Remember, Remember  
The fifth of November,  
The gunpowder treason and plot.  
I know of no reason  
Why the gunpowder treason  
Should ever be forgot.  
  
  


Watched [V for Vendetta](http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/),made after a [comic book of the same title](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_vendetta),today and I have to say, the movie was absolutely marvelous. The plot was great (although it kind of reminded me of [Nineteen-eighty-four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four_(novel)) meets [Phantom of the opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_of_the_opera)). Also the acting and the directing and even the special effects were really awesomely done. The absolutely best moment was when Big Ben's clock face blew out in such a lovely fashion. It stayed completely whole whilst the whole tower just shatter and flew out towards the viewer. Awesome.  
[Natalie Portman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000204/) also did a great job as Evey Hammond, but then again she was great also in Pirates of the Caribbean. She makes a good actor really.
