Through my recent love of one band [The Dresden Dolls](http://www.dresdendolls.com/) I discovered [a funny little video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=vY2WLMf0F_c) they did with [Panic! At The Disco](http://www.panicatthedisco.com/), which nicely shows the relationship between mimes and emos ... It's a bit strange, but I'm sure deep down they realise they're pretty much the same evil crap.
