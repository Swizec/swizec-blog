On Friday my lovely lass had a girls night and left me stranded without anything much to do ... so I didn't.

BUT! After a while I decided to do some writing since this big rush of ideas bubbled into my head, maybe I got smart 'cause I'm about to have a tumor eat my brain away, and I surprisingly managed to come up with five written pages of stuff, almost without crossing anything out, at Zeleni zajec over a cocktail. It was fun writing that much in one go after an extremely long time of not having been able to write anything of use. So over the last two days I managed to somewhat complete the tale, but put in a little cliffhanger at the end so I can continue this promising story about a dwarf and his wife at some other time.

I also went to a striptease club where many interesting things happened, but I probably shouldn't write much about those experiences in such a public place. The fact that I've gone and that those things are a money pit should suffice. So without further ado, here's the first paragraph and the link to [The Lonely Dwarf](http://3pike.org/tales/The_lonely_dwarf.rtf):

```
There was once a dwarf called John who lived in a cottage deep inside the woods with his 
wife Melinda. They led a happy existence full of daily little hurdles and exciting moments to
keep them going.

Their cottage wasnâ€™t large, in fact you could say it was rather small, and it had 
everything they needed. There was a large kitchen, so the dwarf could make his creations in,
 a small study for the dwarf and an adjacent library for them both. There was also a large 
studio for Melinda to do her artistical musings in. She never really made anything of use /../
