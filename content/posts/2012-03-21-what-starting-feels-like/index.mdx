Starting anything is _scary_. Mindbogglingly scary in fact. But somebody's got to do it and if a 4th grader girl can lob herself off a big ski jump, you can stare down that text editor until it produces some code, a blogpost, a business plan or whatever. Certainly the best video I've seen this month :)
