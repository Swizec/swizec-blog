This is the second post in the series of _How &lt;x> changed my style_ where I shall talk about tools and events that had a significant impact on my style of doing things. If you happen to like this idea, I would be very happy if you could help it spread like wildfire, because it's a form of [pay-it-forward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_it_forward "Pay it forward") where we say Thanks for cool stuff. A few weeks ago, or was it days, I forget, I stumbled upon a rather fascinating video about living to be a hundred years old and more. But not just sitting around and waiting to die kind of 100+, the kind where at 100 you're still happily running around, building fences and doing stupid crap most westerners really wouldn't expect you to do anymore.  Everything in there is fine and good, but the most important bottom line I picked up on was the importance of having an _ikigai_. It's all wonderfully explained in the video so I won't go into what ikigai is, I'd rather say a little bit about what it feels like to discover one's ikigai. (it doesn't matter whether you know what it's called or not, I didn't for months) As late as just last Spring my life revolved around going to a school I hated, having a job that was alright but not quite _that_ and occasionally getting together with my girlfriend. I was doing some nifty stuff in the evenings and late at night, but mostly it was just another burden no matter how much I loved it and felt like I believed in it. Then something changed, I can't exactly put my finger on it, but it changed. The symptom of this change was that I quit my job and devoted most of my attention to the side-project, which evolved far far far away from what it was back then. And suddenly much was different. School suddenly seemed interesting and awesome, I started learning exciting new things every day for the first time since being a kid. Getting up in the morning was ... well it's still fucking hard, I'm just not a morning person :P ... but staying up at night was painless as hell. Meh, I won't pretend like I can describe this, just try it.
