Wanted to add nifty new features to the website and update the basic script and I somehow managed to bork most of the configurations and thus removed all the sidebars and static pages in a single swipe. Also installing the new modules isn't going as smoothly as I had hoped due to a bug being discovered in the installation script of Chlorine Boards.

Bottom line is I can't be arsed right now to keep cracking my head with this so I'll finish fixing the site tomorrow. Sory for the inconvenience this causes anyone.
