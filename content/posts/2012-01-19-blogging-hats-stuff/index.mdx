\[caption id="" align="alignright" width="376" caption="Presenting"]![Presenting](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-01-5AVGVH1VUM5DXZFON5TXZN4EWVHI1EK5D5AMTZIUON1SQBHW1.jpg "Presenting")\[/caption] Yesterday I gave a talk at [Kiberpipa](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.056184,14.503798&spn=0.005,0.005&q=46.056184,14.503798 (Kiberpipa)&t=h> "Kiberpipa") on the awesome [#wwwh](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23wwwh) weekly event. The talk was about this blog and how after [that one insanely popular post](http://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night/swizec/3198 "Why programmers work at night")everyone suddenly decided I know what I'm doing and should tell others how its done. _Video at bottom_ It's funny how difficult coming up with a talk is when somebody tweets you _Hey, you should totally come give a talk about blogging._ The problem with these kinds of talk is that you don't really know what you'll be trying to say. Every time you're up there on stage you should have a message - something to convince the audience of. Just giving a general talk _sucks_ for that. It invariably turns into something a bit like this post - a rambling conglomerate of sentences that sort of go together. Always reminds me of that one line in a movie: _You talk a lot, but you don't say much._ I guess the overall message of my talk was this: _Patience! It takes a lot of patience and sticking-to-it-ness, don't do if it isn't inherently fun for you._ Despite all of that I think the talk was a smashing success. Sure I forgot to even mention hats - was supposed to mention changing the blog's name from Cthulhu and Other Crazies to A Geek With a Hat ... oops? In general the talk ended up a bit rambley, even finished with "Wait, there was something else I wanted to say ... oh well. Questions?" That's not a very strong ending. The originally planned ending was: _But hey, at least I'm no longer The Author on hackernews, but Swizec_ All in all, rhetoric sucked, body language was attrocious, hands found their way into pockets several times, but people laughed a few times, asked a bunch of questions and I think everyone had fun. This one girl even asked for actual advice and I thank her for thinking I know enough to give advice about this stuff. The slides for [Blogging, hats, stuff](http://speakerdeck.com/u/swizec/p/blogging-hats-stuff) are over at Speakerdeck whose embeds don't work with Wordpress ... there is also a video.
