The problem I'm trying to solve is the simple but lovely [euler 62](http://projecteuler.net/problem=62).



> The cube, 41063625 (3453), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (3843) and 66430125 (4053). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.

A bit of fun coding after a statistics midterm last night and the solution should be in the bag. Except it isn't, I am doing something wrong somehow and I can't figure out what! Hopefully someone a bit better than me can shed some light whether my proposed solution is wrong or I just suck at [Haskell](http://haskell.org "Haskell (programming language)").



## Algorithm



1. Generate cubes up to 10,000
2. Every cube is a pair of a digit-ordered string _n^3_ and _n,_for instance _("279",9)_
3. Order cubes by the string number presentation
4. Group together all cubes with the same _n^3_
5. Pick out groups with the size of 5
6. Sort by _n_
7. Pick the smallest number

Should work in principle right? So why doesn't the website accept my answer _(5027)_? My guess is I'm doing something wrong in the sorting and grouping department and I was hoping someone with a bit more knowledge of Haskell could point out where I'm being stupid.



## Code



```
\import Data.List

cubes::(Num a) => a -> [(String, a)]
cubes 1 = [(show 1, 1)]
cubes n = (sort$show(n^3), n):(cubes $ n-1)

sortStrNum (s1, n1) (s2, n2)
  | length s1 == length s2 = compare s1 s2
  | otherwise = compare (length s1) (length s2)

permuted_cubes n =
  groupBy (\a b -> fst a == fst b) $ sortBy sortStrNum $ cubes n

fives n =
  filter (\xs -> length xs == 5) $ permuted_cubes n

comparing p x y = compare (p x) (p y)

smallest =
  head $ sortBy (comparing snd) $ head $ fives 100000
```



The whole thing looks kind of alright to me, no matter how much I poke around it doesn't seem like something is misbehaving ... but it still is.



Ideas?
