Yet again I've been asked to make a site work with IE6 and it's just fucking stupid that they ask of me to waste that much time on something as stupid. You don't ask an engineer to make a hydrogen car run on petrol just because petrol is around where people buy the car. You don't ask an engineer to make a diesel locomotive run on steam just because the owner has a bunch of wood to burn. You don't ask the whole world to write documents only in notepad because you're too lazy to install Office.  
  
For the love of god people, I don't give a fuck about an OLD browser. There's a new version and it's been out for TWO FUCKING years! If you still haven't bloody updated then it's your own fucking fault if the internet doesn't work for you.  
  
Next time my boss asks me to support IE6 I'm gonna tell them I won't do it and if they want it done they can just find somebody else to do it. Hell, I could get a better paying, but more stressful and farther away from home, job in a matter of days ... if they don't like my work, fine.  
  
  
  
They don't ask the designers to do their designs in MSPaint, so why should I be asked to do my work in an antique? If they (my boss) can go a week using only software from 2k1 and before then I'll gladly support IE6.
