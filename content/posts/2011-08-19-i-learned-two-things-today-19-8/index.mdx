Didn't expect this at all, but I'm glad I know someone from Google and could buy some crap I don't actually need anyway. But those plushies are so fucking fluffy I'm gonna die! (that was a reference by the way, did you catch it?) Another thing I learned is that I have zero knowledge about how memory management works in node.js. Had a process misbehaving today that looked like there was a huge memory leak. The damn thing was wasting something like 400 megs of RAM without doing anything. Started exploring and trying to figure out what could be leaking ... voila, boom, memory use drops to normal levels. I even tried some experiments that I was certain would produce memory leaks (leaving references to scopes inside closures and so on) and nothing I tried wanted to produce a memory leak. And no matter what I tried the server process just wouldn't do anything stupid again. I should look into this more.
