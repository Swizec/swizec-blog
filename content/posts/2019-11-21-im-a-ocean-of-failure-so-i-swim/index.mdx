Do you know that game, abysmall failure at life and everything or hungry? It's a fun game, I play it often.

To be honest, I don't know where it comes from. Maybe it's like being hangry ‚Äì you lack energy so your emotions run wild. Whatever they are.



For me it likes to sneak up when I look at past achievements that I was so proud to achieve and think _"You could've done better and you know it_. I could've, but I didn't. I am where I am.

Note to self: Do not look at metrics when you're hungry. Keep forgetting that one üòÖ

In a nutshell:



- accept yourself
- remove toxic influence
- mind the wins



And remember, I love and accept you for who you are ‚ù§Ô∏è



Happy Thursday,
