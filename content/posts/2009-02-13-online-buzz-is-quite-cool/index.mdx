Yesterday I had my first ever experience in being on the receiving end of some proper online buzz with [Twitulater](http://twitulater.com). It started out with [a writeup on go2web2.0](http://blog.go2web20.net/2009/02/twitulater-is-so-great-why-does-it-have.html), which I thought was just another blog mentioning Twitulater, two days ago. Hey cool, so I commented. How wrong I was!

The blog turned out to be something read by a lot of people, even, it would seem a somewhat \\important blog since the very next day when I searched twitter for mentions there were a [TON](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=twitulater). I think the number stopped at just over 20 and although I realise that's not a lot for many products out there, but it's quite a big deal to me. Best part was how I even got some congrats from people for that writeup. Yay!

All of this had a wonderful consequence of website visits being about ten times larger than usual yesterday. Sure, in my case this meant only 100 visits, but for a project that usually gets under ten visits a day, I do think getting a hundred is magnificent. In fact, some microblogging service contacted me and asked if I could integrate their API. Haven't replies yet, but it's looking very likely to happen.

Must say I'm quite glad how well Twitulater is turning out as a project and it's almost unbelievable that, with all the other stuff going on in my life, I've come so far in a mere four months. Loving the whole ride!
