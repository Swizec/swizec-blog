Today my girlfriend held a monster by the boobs and I got to see a very nice looking castle aptly named Schoenbrun and we went to see an art gallery inside Belvedere where there were pretty pictures.

And now since I'm a tad knackered from all the walking, here's a bunch of photos you probably won't want to look at since you're all bastards.
