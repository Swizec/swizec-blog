As it would appear today was a very impulsive day as there were many things that occured on pure impulse.

One of such things was the idea to go and get some new hair to crown my head with and it really turned out quite well, I like it and it's a nice, although huge, change. It was done in a true silly person manner as well, when I got there I pulled out a screencap of Depp from Secret Window and said that I wanted that. Promptly enough the hair went from nipple length to just short of chin length.

The other thing was an impulse buy of the trashiest of trashy newspapers the country has to offer for the reason of getting a Fawly Towers DVD. Sad part is I got burned and it only contains 3 episodes and those in not too good quality, stupid thing.
