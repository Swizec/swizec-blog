Last night I discovered another cool mathematical concept akin to the [Collatz conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture "Collatz conjecture") - [Lychrel numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_numbers). \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Image via Wikipedia"][![Collatz map fractal in a neighbourhood of the ...](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-01-300px-CollatzFractal4.png "Collatz map fractal in a neighbourhood of the ...")](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CollatzFractal.png)\[/caption] The idea of a lychrel number is pretty straightforward: Take a number, add its reverse, continue until you reach a [palindrome number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number "Palindromic number"). If you never reach a [palindrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome "Palindrome"), then this is a [Lychrel number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number "Lychrel number"). Something like this:

> 349 + 943 = 1292, 1292 + 2921 = 4213 4213 + 3124 = 7337 not lychrel

If you've ever done any theoretical computer science, you'll immediately spot a problem. This isn't a very good algorithm. Problem is with that "never" word in the description - an algorithm is a finite set of steps, when you need an infinite amount of steps to reach a conclusion that's ... not very useful. Honestly I am not certain what class of problems lychrel numbers fall into. The "not a lychrel number" is a half-[decidable problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem "Decision problem"). It will always tell you when _a number is not lychrel_ but it will never terminate when it is. If my understanding is correct, this would make "is a lychrel number" an non-decidable problem. [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/ "Project Euler") is kind enough to limit the problem a little bit and make it a fun algorithm to write before bed when your brain is half dead. _Find all lychrel candidates under 10,000 assuming it should never take more than 50 iterations._ Solving _that_ problem becomes rather trivial in [Haskell](http://haskell.org "Haskell (programming language)"):

```

reverse' = read . reverse . show

palindrome n = n == reverse' n

-- max denotes max recursion depth
lychrel n max
  | max <= 0 = True
  | palindrome$n+r = False
  | otherwise = lychrel (n+r) (max-1)
    where r = reverse' n

lychrels max =
  length [x | x <- [1..max], lychrel x 50]
```

Oh and actually the first number that needs more than 50 iterations to converge into a palindrome is 10677, so the problem is pretty safely stated. For a final bit of fun, the number 4994, itself a palindrome, is a lychrel candidate.
