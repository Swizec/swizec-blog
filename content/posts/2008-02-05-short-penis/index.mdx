Lately I've been receiving a lot of emails about my penis being short and ways of fixing the problem. I always wonder just how the hell do they know that I have a small penis? It's remarkable! Do they make demographic research to find out who has a short weener? Or is there some kind of intricate heuristic algorithm at work?

Well no, I probably just managed to post my email address somewhere a certain bot managed to read it, so now I've been tagged as a short weener guy (not saying it's not true). I used to receive a lot more of these a few years ago when my weener was even smaller and then for a few years where I was completely and totally secure about its size there were none. Now that I'm a tad less secure there's the emails again.

Personally I find that interesting ... that there seems to be a correlation between the amount of spam messages for penis size increase and a person's security over the size of their member. How the hell!? Well I really canot be certain of how the hell that works, but it still feels as an interesting observation.

Well anyhow, as long as I can pee with it ... you know ... fulfill its basic function and such ...

While on the topic of spam. I keep getting an interesting emotion or whatever it is over seeing students my age, or even older ones, working in this office. The feeling doesn't stem quite from that, I'm a student working here after all. It comes from the difference in job descriptions. While they create spam envelopes for regular mail or answer the phones, I'm the semi-well paid programmer who gets to be creative and is listened to by the bosses as far as recommendations and such go.

Life is good ... mostly.
