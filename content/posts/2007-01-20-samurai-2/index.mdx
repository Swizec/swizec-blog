On a certain forum I sometimes visit somebody posted an animation they did, a cartoon to be more precise. It seems to be made using odd shamanistic techniques of professional artists with a tinge of pepper and a dash of magic to create [this beautiful short cartoon](http://www.threeleggedlegs.com/work/samurai/) that will blow you away.
