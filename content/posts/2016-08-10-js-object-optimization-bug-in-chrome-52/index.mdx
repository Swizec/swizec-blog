That was on Friday. I still don’t know _why_ the bug happens, but I can reproduce it. Evidence says it’s a Chrome 52 bug, not a general JavaScript bug. Neither Safari nor Firefox make it happen.

Sometimes when you call `.fetch()` on a Backbone model, callbacks don’t fire. There’s no JavaScript error, the REST call works, the result is vanished by the browser. Joy of joys.

You need:

-   Webpack
-   Babel 6
-   Backbone (maybe Backbone is doing it wrong?)
-   A server that can serve JSON files
-   14 lines of code

I used `create-react-app` to set up a basic environment, ejected with `npm run eject` and added some config to Webpack to allow jQuery. Backbone depends on it. This part is not _that_ relevant.

To show the bug itself, we need a Backbone model:

    // A basic Backbone model
    class BugModel extends Backbone.Model {
        constructor() {
            super();

            this.url = "bla.json";
        }
    }

Now I know what you’re thinking, that’s an ES6 object and Backbone was built before ES6. Official docs never mention the new `class` syntax. The traditional Backbone approach works too:

    var BugModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
        url: "bla.json"
    });

The same bug happens. I tried.

To cause the bug, we have to call `.fetch()` on two instances of `BugModel` that share the same `id`. The code looks like this:

    let bug = new BugModel();
    bug.fetch({
        success: () => {
            console.log('fetch 1'); // this happens
            doWeirdness(bug);
        }
    });

    function doWeirdness(bug) {
        let newBug = new BugModel({id: bug.id});

        console.log('about to re-fetch');

        newBug.fetch({
            success: () => console.log('fetch 2', newBug), // don't get here
            error: () => console.log('error')
        });
    }

We create an instance of `BugModel` in a variable called `bug`, then call `.fetch()`. This makes an API call to `/bla.json`, which returns a JSON file that looks like this: `{"id": 1, "hai": "hello"}`.

Backbone automagically parses this JSON string and sets an `id` and `hai` attribute. This part works like a charm.

Then we call `doWeirdness` and pass our `bug` object as an attribute. Inside `doWeirdness`, we make a new instance of `BugModel` called `newBug` and give it the same `id` as `bug` had. This is a crucial step.

When we call `fetch` on this new instance, the API call happens, but the callbacks do not. `'fetch 2'` never prints.

This whole sequence of events might sound redundant, but it made sense in my real codebase. Even if re-fetching objects doesn’t make sense, it _should_ work. It works in both Safari and Firefox.

## Clues about why

This smells like a bug in memory optimization. Chrome thinks `bug` and `newBug` are the same object, even though they are not.

If you call `fetch()` twice on the same instance of `BugModel`, the same bug happens. (clue, part 1)

If both instances have a different `id`, both `fetch` calls fire callbacks. (clue, part 2)

Curiously, if you add a third `fetch()` call, that works.

        newBug.fetch({
            success: () => console.log('fetch 2', newBug), // don't get here
            error: () => console.log('error')
        });

        newBug.fetch({
            success: () => console.log('fetch 3') // prints
        });

The bug didn’t happen in Chrome 51.

I am confused. ?
