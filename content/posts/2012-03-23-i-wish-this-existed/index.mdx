This happens because not a single writing tool can tell me _Hey you, yes you, you're using too many [filler words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_%28linguistics%29 "Filler (linguistics)"), yo!_ Ever since the 1990's programmers have been using a key piece of technology. An ubiquitous piece of tech that exists in even the most trivial of [code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code "Code") editors, something that makes the life of a [coder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer "Programmer") survivable.

## Syntax highlighting!

This is what code looked like before [syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax "Syntax") highlighting. Working with this wasn't impossible ... the longest piece of code I came up with was probably upwards of 4000 lines of very horrible code ... hey, I was 12, cut me some slack. \[caption id="attachment_4049" align="alignnone" width="640" caption="Turbo Pascal 6"][![Turbo Pascal 6](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/turbo_pascal.png "Turbo Pascal 6")](./img/turbo_pascal.png)\[/caption] I still remember the incredible joy that came with installing Turbo Pascal 7. [Syntax Highlighting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting "Syntax highlighting") baby! No seriously, the code was suddenly _better_. Life in general was _better_. I would compare [quality of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life "Quality of life") before and after syntax highlighting to losing one's virginity. It is literally _that_ awesome. \[caption id="attachment_4050" align="alignnone" width="670" caption="Turbo Pascal 7"][![Turbo Pascal 7](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/turbo_pascal_7_scholl_pack_13_640966.png "Turbo Pascal 7")](./img/turbo_pascal_7_scholl_pack_13_640966.png)\[/caption] I remember spending a lot of time just tweaking the highlighter settings, making sure everything looked just right. A well set up syntax highlighter makes you feel at home :) These days I no longer pay much attention to syntax highlighting, I just take it for granted. If a file looks wrong in [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs "Emacs"), you simply go on the internets, download the appropriate mode and voila, code looks good again.

## Natural language syntax highlighting

Coding isn't all I do anymore, though A lot of my time is spent [writing every day](http://swizec.com/blog/on-writing-every-day/swizec/3058). My editors though ... are kind of lame. When writing English my "code" still looks like it was 1994: \[caption id="attachment_4052" align="alignnone" width="790" caption="Distractionless writing"][![Distractionless writing](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-23-at-11.57.31-AM.png "Distractionless writing")](./img/Screen-Shot-2012-03-23-at-11.57.31-AM.png)\[/caption] Writing without distractions is all fine and good, but syntax highlighting isn't a distraction! It's helpful! What if instead of a cold hard piece of text staring back at me from the editor, there was something like this instead: \[caption id="attachment_4054" align="alignnone" width="506" caption="English syntax highlighting"][![English syntax highlighting](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-23-at-12.34.24-PM.png "English syntax highlighting")](./img/Screen-Shot-2012-03-23-at-12.34.24-PM.png)\[/caption] This is just a simple mockup I put together in html in about 20 minutes. Syntax highlighting on the level of words

-   verbs are pink
-   pronouns are green
-   nouns are blue
-   errors have a red background

Not sure how visible it is, but when editing a sentence, it would be useful for the start and end of it to be highlighted with a light blue hue ... just like parenthesis matching when coding! It would be really cool if syntax highlighting for [natural languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") went beyond words and onto concepts, where it isn't just the noun that turns blue, but all adjectives attached to it would get a blue-ish background. That would help _incredibly_ when it comes to overloading.

## Who could use this?

If natural languages were a bit simpler, we'd already have syntax [highlighters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlighter "Highlighter") ... or maybe nobody's thought of this before? I for one do enough writing that I would pay for something like this. Make it a wordpress plugin or something ... or an emacs mode. I don't care, I want it! Hopefully I'm not the only person who needs this, there is a whole market of book and magazine editors, professional writers, journalists and so on who could benefit from something like this. However, all of those people will never _ask_ for syntax highlighting, I doubt many of them even realize such a concept exists.
