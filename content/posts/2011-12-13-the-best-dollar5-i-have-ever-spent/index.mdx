It's a self-produced, self-published, self-everything hour of laughter inducing madness. That's right, you _will_ laugh. _Out loud._No, not just "lol". I mean _laugh_. He also put up what is probably the best anti-pirating plea I have read in a while; of course it only works if you aren't a big corporation and have no intention of suing me for damages up to [$150k every time I pirate a 5minute song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America#Selection_of_defendants).

> **To those who might wish to "torrent" this video:** look, I don't really get the whole "torrent" thing. I don't know enough about it to judge either way. But I'd just like you to consider this: I made this video extremely easy to use against well-informed advice. I was told that it would be easier to torrent the way I made it, but I chose to do it this way anyway, because I want it to be easy for people to watch and enjoy this video in any way they want without "corporate" restrictions. Please bear in mind that I am not a company or a corporation. I'm just some guy. I paid for the production and posting of this video with my own money. I would like to be able to post more material to the fans in this way, which makes it cheaper for the buyer and more pleasant for me. So, please help me keep this being a good idea. I can't stop you from [torrenting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29 "BitTorrent (protocol)"); all I can do is politely ask you to pay your five little dollars, enjoy the video, and let other people find it in the same way. Sincerely, Louis C.K.

Certainly the best five bucks I have ever spent ... hell, you pay almost as much for a good tea at Starbucks and that doesn't leave nearly as lasting an impression. I'd love to tell you what was so special about it, but this is standup comedy, if I try to tell you it will just come out pathetic and we'll both feel kind of awkward about it. If for whatever odd reason you have no idea who this Louis C.K. person is, and shame on you if you don't, here's a helpful video.
