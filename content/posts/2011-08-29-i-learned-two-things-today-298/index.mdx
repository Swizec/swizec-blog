Today I learned that updating my laptop to [Mac OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/ "Mac OS X") Lion caused a very strange issue with my home wireless network. Actually I learned the issue was tehre as soon as I got back home, but didn't really have time to look into it ... apparently it no longer supports WPA encryption and my router doesn't support anything stronger than WPA. Sad, I know, but that's what it is. The only symptom of this is an error report along the liens of "There is a timeout" and instantly dropping the connection. When I turn off encryption the damn thing connects happily as ever. Now granted WPA isn't very strong, but it's still stronger than nothing ... the only sense I can see here is that [Apple](http://www.apple.com "Apple") wants to protect me from a false sense of security? Guess I'm getting a new [wi-fi router](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi "Wi-Fi") soon. Any recommendations? Another thing I learned is that it is much cheaper to buy _twelve_ fluffy things for a whiteboard eraser than a new eraser. You can only buy twelve at a time otherwise I would have bought one since this one has lasted me what ... two, three years? Well ever since I got a whiteboard at home anyway. So I think I'm good until the end of time with this batch. Of course I'll lose them first and have to buy a new pack every time I want to replace. Good business model that, sell twelve times as much as the customer needs, produce endless amounts of waste. Oh and [everyone got their postcards](http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-21-8/swizec/2275 "I learned two things today 21.8.") today. Yay!
