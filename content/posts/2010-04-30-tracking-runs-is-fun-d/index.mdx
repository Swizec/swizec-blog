Today I finally figured out how to get sportypal working. Tomorrow I'm testing the hypotesis to make sure it wasn't a one-time fluke.



The trick is to start it up when you're home. Then after the warmup walk kill it and open it again. This time GPS connect is instant.



But the true lesson for today is that tracking runs is FUN. I even got a map and everything :D Sure it looks a bit weird where it decided I was running zigzag through houses and trees and cars and garages and pretty much everything at a sooper speed of **30!**kilometers per hour.



But hey, it's a blackberry not an iPhone (or Android), so I shan't complain. I'm just glad I can finally use this crap.



Hmmm ... for some reason wordpress won't let me embed the map, so here's a screenshot.
