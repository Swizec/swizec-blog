_This is a Livecoding Recap – an almost-weekly post about interesting things discovered while livecoding ?. Always under 500 words and with pictures. You can follow my channel, [here](https://livecoding.tv/swizec). New content almost **every Sunday at 2pm PDT**. There’s live chat, come say hai ?_

This week we made a circle bounce back and forth. ?

Trivial, right? Yes, as trivial as it gets. The bouncing circle wasn’t the point, the point was how it’s made. This: [react-transitionable-component](https://github.com/Swizec/react-transitionable-component). My first not-just-a-cool-experiment open source contribution to the React ecosystem.

It’s an abstract component that makes building transitions easy.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve noticed that making a transition always follows the same pattern: move props to state, render from state instead of props, use `d3.transition` to transition prop values on every `componentWillReceiveProps`. What if we can abstract all that work away? ?

We started with this jumping circle:

And ended with this transitioned circle:

It took me over an hour to realize that zooming-in would have made everyone’s lives easier, but here we are. Tiny little gifs for tiny little screens. Or big screens. The gifs are always tiny.

Making a circle that transitions like that isn’t hard. It takes about twenty minutes to show and explain to a novice in both React and D3. At least that’s how much it takes when I do workshops.

So who cares about making abstraction, right? I care. Doing it from scratch every time gets old, fast. I wanted a way to say _“make this component use transitions for everything.”_ without worrying about implementation every time.

As you can expect from a project that took less than two hours from start to finish, there’s little code to show. [40 lines](https://github.com/Swizec/react-transitionable-component/blob/master/src/TransitionableComponent.js) that look like this:

    class TransitionableComponent extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
            // copy all props to state
            // call _defineEasing and _defineDuration
        }

        _defineEasing(easing) {
            // if this.easing undefined, get easing function from d3
        }

        _defineDuration(duration) {
            // if this.duration undefined, set it
        }

        componentWillReceiveProps(newProps) {
            this._defineEasing(newProps.easing);
            this._defineDuration(newProps.duration);

            const node = d3.select(this.refs.node);

            let transition = node.transition()
                                 .ease(this.easing);

            if (this.duration !== undefined) {
                transition.duration(this.duration);
            }

            Object.keys(newProps)
                  .forEach((k) => {
                      transition.attr(k, newProps[k]);
                  });

            transition.on('end', () => this.setState(newProps));
        }
    }

I cut out the boring bits. You can see them on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/Swizec/react-transitionable-component/blob/master/src/TransitionableComponent.js).

The fun bit is in `componentWillReceiveProps`. We update our easing function and our duration, which should’ve been dynamic getters instead. Then we get the `node` and start a `transition()` with an easing function, and a `duration`, if it’s there. After that, we walk through every prop and add it to the pile of transitioning attributes with `.attr`. When the transition is over, we use the `'end'` callback to update component state and ensure React understands what’s going on.

You’ll notice `TransitionableComponent` doesn’t have a `render()` function. It’s an abstract component meant to be extended by a real component. Something like this:

    class Circle extends TransitionableComponent {
        render() {
            return 
        }
    }

That’s a transitionable circle now. Any props passed into it are transitioned. You have to be careful to use `this.state` instead of `this.props` when using them though.

Using the `Circle` component looks like this:

        

See, easy. :)

Join me next week when we clean this up to use dynamic getters, avoid importing the entire d3 library, and build some examples.
