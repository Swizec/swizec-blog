[Seedcamp](http://www.seedcamp.com "Seedcamp"), as many probably know, is a bit like [America's Next Top Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Next_Top_Model "America's Next Top Model"), but for entrepreneurs and their ideas.

- decide to give it a new wrapping and rework the whole thing with help from some awesome people
- realise something like this would do great on seedcamp with the right pitch
