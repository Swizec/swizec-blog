> We’re really excited to launch our first version of Instagram today, [free in the App Store](itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8). Instagram makes mobile photos _fast, simple, & beautiful_.

> When we sat down three months ago to start designing our product, we looked at [digital photos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography "Digital photography") and realized very few exciting things had happened in the last 5 years. We’re setting out to change that, and this release is our first step along the way.

Just 19 months later, on April 9th, 2012 (yesterday), a new piece of news came along

> When Mike and I started Instagram nearly two years ago, we set out to change and improve the way the world communicates and shares. We’ve had an amazing time watching Instagram grow into a vibrant community of people from all around the globe. Today, we couldn’t be happier to announce that Instagram has agreed to be acquired by [Facebook](http://facebook.com "Facebook").

As an [early adopter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter "Early adopter"), I was along for the ride almost since the very beginning - my first instagram photo going online on November 5th, 2010. Yes, I'm an Instagram fanboy! And_I feel included_ in the success because I've been rooting for them so long.



But let's just put that billion dollar acquisition into perspective:

- _45 million dollars_ for every month worked on Instagram
- _76 million dollars_ per employee (just 13 of them according to Wikipedia)
- about _30 dollars_ for every user
- about _a dollar_ for every photo

And **that** is what startups are about. Creating value. _Ridiculous amounts_ of value.



For even more perspective - if your average university education was providing as much value as Instagram does for both its founders and its users ... someone would have to dump _3.2 billion dollars_ in your lap as a graduation gift.



Some of you might be wondering what's so special about Instagram anyway, how can they command such a high valuation, what to users see in them?



To that, all I can say is ... remember what sharing a photo was like before Instagram? All that uploading to a twitpic service, then posting to twitter and to facebook and whatever ... it was a pain in the arse.



More \\importantly, filters are just about the only way you can make a mobile photo look any better than a bland piece of crap with poor lighting. And as a faithful Instagram fan, I'm sticking by this interpretation.
