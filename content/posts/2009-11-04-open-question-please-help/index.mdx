Ok so it's actually two questions:

1. Why does viewing morality (and related) as a set of arbitrary rules always seem to get me in trouble?
2. Could you suggest some reading material so I could learn what the fuck the word 'offensive' is supposed to mean? It feels like a very alien concept and I would rather not keep clashing with my environment about it.
