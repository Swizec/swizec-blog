What would happen? ðŸ¤” \[caption id="attachment_7979" align="alignnone" width="1404"]![Blockchain in a nutshell](./img/carbon-blockchain.png) Blockchain in a nutshell\[/caption] So I fired up [this amazing Medium post](https://medium.com/@lhartikk/a-blockchain-in-200-lines-of-code-963cc1cc0e54) on building a blockchain in 200 lines of code and built a blockchain-backed Redux clone in about 2 hours. Mine is just 105 lines tho ðŸ˜› You can see the [code on Github](https://github.com/Swizec/blockchain-redux). It's not quite useful yet. The blockchain doesn't get shared between nodes, and there's no proof-of-stake or proof-of-work algorithm. That's all coming soon. First, I wanted to make sure I understood both [blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) and Redux enough to make this work.

## Blockchain

Turns out blockchains are pretty simple. It's just a reversed linked list where every node holds some data, a hash, and points to the previous node. ![Image borrowed from Lauri Hartikka's post](./img/1*pbyFH4U5sO27UE1EjnImoA.png) We use the hashes to verify our chain. Verification is important when we start sharing chains between nodes. Our blocks are JavaScript objects.

    class Block {
        constructor({ previousBlock, data }) {
            this.index = previousBlock.index + 1;
            this.previousHash = previousBlock.hash.toString();
            this.timestamp = new Date().getTime() / 1000;
            this.data = data;

            this.hash = Block.calculateHash(this);
        }

        set data(data) {
            this._data = JSON.stringify(data);
        }

        get data() {
            return JSON.parse(this._data);
        }

        // this is where a Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake algo comes in, I think
        static calculateHash(block) {
            return CryptoJS.SHA256(
                block.index + block.previousHash + block.timestamp + block._data
            ).toString();
        }
    }

The `constructor` doubles as our block generator. It takes the `previousBlock` and some `data`, adds some metadata, and calculates a `hash`. A `data` setter and getter help us JSONify data transparently. Users can pass simple objects as data, and the blockchain will handle it. The `calculateHash` function right now just uses SHA256, but I think this is where a [proof of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) or a [proof of stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) algorithm would come into play in a real blockchain. Haven't figured that part out yet :) Kind of surprisingly, that's all we need to build a blockchain. You could build it like this `new Block({ previousBlock: new Block({ previousBlock: genesisBlock, data: {hai: "world"}}), data: {hai2: "world2"}})` But that's cumbersome, so let's add a Redux.

## Redux

Redux, if you don't know, is a state management approach based on the functional concept of a `reducer`. At each change, we take the current state and a change descriptor, and produce the next state. A tiny Redux implementation that maintains history would look something like this ðŸ‘‡

    function createStore(initialState, reducer) {
        let state = [initialState];
     
        function getState() {
            return state[state.length-1];
        }
     
        function dispatch(action) {
            state.push(reducer(getState(), action));
        }
     
        return {
            getState: getState,
            dispatch: dispatch
        }
    }

ðŸ‘† That's Redux in a nutshell. Unlike the real Redux, this one maintains history. We'll expand that into a blockchain. `getState` returns the latest state and `dispatch` takes an `action` and calculates the new state using the `reducer` function. Using this Redux to implement a counter looks like this ðŸ‘‡

    const store = createStore({ counter: 0 }, rootReducer);

    function rootReducer(state, action) {
        switch (action.type) {
            case "inc":
                return { counter: state.counter + 1 };
            case "dec":
                return { counter: state.counter - 1 };
            default:
                return state;
        }
    }

We can use this to verify that it works. Using tape in this case because [LukeEd05](https://twitter.com/lukeed05) on the livestream suggested it.

    test("count to 5", t => {
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            store.dispatch({ type: "inc" });
        }

        t.equal(store.getState().counter, 5);
        t.end();
    });

Works ðŸ‘Œ

## blockchain-redux

Now, how do we add the blockchain? ðŸ¤” Well, instead of putting `initialState` directly into our state, we put a genesis Block with that state. And instead of pushing new state calculations directly, we add blocks.

    function createStore(initialState, reducer) {
        let blockchain = [
            new Block({ 
                previousBlock: {
                    index: 0,
                    hash: "0",
                    timestamp: new Date().getTime()
                },
                data: initialState
            })
        ];

        function getLastBlock() {
            return blockchain[blockchain.length - 1];
        }

        function dispatch(action) {
            const lastBlock = getLastBlock();
            const nextData = reducer(lastBlock.data, action);

            addBlock(new Block({ previousBlock: lastBlock, data: nextData }));
        }

        function addBlock(newBlock) {
            if (isValidNewBlock(newBlock, getLastBlock())) {
                blockchain.push(newBlock);
            }
        }

        function isValidNewBlock(newBlock, previousBlock) {
            if (previousBlock.index + 1 !== newBlock.index) {
                console.log("invalid index");
                return false;
            } else if (previousBlock.hash !== newBlock.previousHash) {
                console.log("invalid previoushash");
                return false;
            } else if (Block.calculateHash(newBlock) !== newBlock.hash) {
                console.log(
                    "invalid hash: ",
                    Block.calculateHash(newBlock),
                    newBlock.hash
                );
                return false;
            }
            return true;
        }

        function isValidChain(blockchain) {
            for (let i = 0; i < blockchain.length - 1; i++) {
                if (!isValidNewBlock(blockchain[i + 1], blockchain[i])) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        }

        function replaceChain(newBlocks) {
            if (isValidChain(newBlocks) && newBlocks.length > blockchain.length) {
                blockchain = newBlocks;
                // tell others here
            }
        }

        return {
            getState: () => getLastBlock().data,
            getLastBlock: getLastBlock,
            dispatch: dispatch,
            addBlock: addBlock,
            replaceChain: replaceChain, // primarily used when starting up to take latest available blockchain
            _blockchain: blockchain
        };
    }

Okay that's plenty of code to spring on you. Let's go through it function by function.

### getState

        function getLastBlock() {
            return blockchain[blockchain.length - 1];
        }

Takes last block from the blockchain and returns it. That's our current state. We export a helper `getState` that does `getLastBlock().data` to avoid changing external APIs.

### Dispatch

        function dispatch(action) {
            const lastBlock = getLastBlock();
            const nextData = reducer(lastBlock.data, action);

            addBlock(new Block({ previousBlock: lastBlock, data: nextData }));
        }

Same as `dispatch` before. Takes current state and builds new state with the `reducer`. Then it uses `addBlock` to insert a newly generated block into the chain.

### isValidNewBlock

        function isValidNewBlock(newBlock, previousBlock) {
            if (previousBlock.index + 1 !== newBlock.index) {
                console.log("invalid index");
                return false;
            } else if (previousBlock.hash !== newBlock.previousHash) {
                console.log("invalid previoushash");
                return false;
            } else if (Block.calculateHash(newBlock) !== newBlock.hash) {
                console.log(
                    "invalid hash: ",
                    Block.calculateHash(newBlock),
                    newBlock.hash
                );
                return false;
            }
            return true;
        }

Every new block has to be validated. Especially because they can come from other nodes. This checks that indexes and hashes all match up so we can avoid conflicts.

### isValidChain

       function isValidChain(blockchain) {
            for (let i = 0; i < blockchain.length - 1; i++) {
                if (!isValidNewBlock(blockchain[i + 1], blockchain[i])) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        }

This will be used later on in conflict resolution. It goes through an entire proposed chain and validates every block.

### replaceChain

        function replaceChain(newBlocks) {
            if (isValidChain(newBlocks) && newBlocks.length > blockchain.length) {
                blockchain = newBlocks;
                // tell others here
            }
        }

Another part of conflict resolution and node communication is replacing the whole chain. If a new valid chain comes in that's longer than what we already have, we replace our internal state with the new chain. This will be particularly useful when we boot up a new client and it needs to get the whole chain.

## Fin

That's pretty much it. A naive blockchain implementation that gives you a Redux-like API to store and manipulate data. Next I'm going to add communication between nodes, probably through Firebase, and a proof-of-stake algorithm. Then we can start building something interesting. And maybe you now understand blockchains a little better ðŸ¤“
