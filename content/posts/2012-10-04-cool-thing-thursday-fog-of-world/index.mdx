[![Area of world explored](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/area-explored.png "Area of world explored")](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-10-area-explored.png) [![Percentage of world explored](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/percentage-explored.png "Percentage of world explored")](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-10-percentage-explored.png) [Fog of World](http://fogofworld.com) is a toy. A wonderful magnificent toy I wouldn't let you pry from my cold dead fingers! And I wish it came out six months ago, not last week. What is it? \[caption id="attachment_5368" align="alignright" width="307" caption="Fog over my world"][![Fog over my world](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ljubljana-fog.png "Fog over my world")](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-10-ljubljana-fog.png)\[/caption] Oh it's just an _awesome_ visualisation of where you've been in your life and how much of the world you've explored so far. That runs on your [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone "iPhone"). And sucks the ever living hell out of your battery with the GPS chip. To be honest, I'm not even certain why I like it. Probably the same reason I like [Foursquare](http://www.foursquare.com/ "Foursquare") ... it's just incredibly cool to have a historical log of where you've been and what you've been up to. Call me sentimental, but that's really cool. Even though I find looking at old photographs boring, a log of locations? Sold. Maybe I'm just a traveler at heart. The more \\important aspect of Fog of World is that it affects your life ever so imperceptibly. Walking around town yesterday - less than a kilometer from home - I discovered a new street. Just because I wanted to expand my fog of world a bit, get that tiny small percentage more. Explore just a bit. It was marvelous. I love it when software gently nudges me to expand my horizons. That said, this has been a marvelous year for traveling. I've been to [London](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.5072222222,-0.1275&spn=0.1,0.1&q=51.5072222222,-0.1275 (London)&t=h> "London"), [Novi Sad](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.25,19.85&spn=0.1,0.1&q=45.25,19.85 (Novi%20Sad)&t=h> "Novi Sad"), [Belgrade](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=44.8205555556,20.4622222222&spn=0.1,0.1&q=44.8205555556,20.4622222222 (Belgrade)&t=h> "Belgrade"), [Dubrovnik](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95 "Old City of Dubrovnik"), [Zurich](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=47.3666666667,8.55&spn=0.1,0.1&q=47.3666666667,8.55 (Zurich)&t=h> "Zurich") and I'm going to Paris in a week. If only this app existed 6 months earlier, there would be much less fog over my world. But hey, just discovered I can \\import all my [RunKeeper](http://www.runkeeper.com/ "RunKeeper") data going back to early 2011. Sweet! \[caption id="attachment_5371" align="alignnone" width="406" caption="Downtown perambulations are quite sporadic"][![Downtown perambulations are quite sporadic](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/downtown-ljubljana-fog.png "Downtown perambulations are quite sporadic")](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-10-downtown-ljubljana-fog.png)\[/caption] \[caption id="attachment_5372" align="alignnone" width="384" caption="The app eggs you on to travel more"][![The app eggs you on to travel more](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/photo-3.png "The app eggs you on to travel more")](./img/blog-wp-content-uploads-2012-10-photo-3.png)\[/caption]
