![Academics](./img/B556uUtqTkyDg4jyZvHr) For the past few days I've been trying to find a measurable definition for _"energy levels"_. Not in terms of physics, but in terms of _"Today I just don't have the energy to work."_, or _"I always get so sleepy after lunch and can't get anything done"_. Everyone knows their energy levels fluctuate through the day, but that's not good enough. For [Why programmers work at night](http://leanpub.com/nightowls), I wanted to find _what_ these mythical energy levels are exactly. The term I was looking for was _"mental energy"_. Excitement abounds! After days of fussing, I finally know what to search for! Giddily I discovered research on mental energy is alive and busy. A lot of articles published in the last few years, all of them looking very relevant to what I'm interested in. But I think scientific [publishers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing "Publishing") don't want me to cite [original research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research "Research") in my work. Can anything else explain the ridiculous paywalls they have in place? Out of some 20 interesting articles I found, only six had free pdf's available online. And of those, only two or three were easily available. After numerous citation pages with nothing more than an abstract posted, I have culled my list down to four really great sounding articles with the total cost of $207. **$207 for 4 articles.**

-   [Sensitivity to Change in Cognitive Performance and Mood Measures of Energy and Fatigue in Response to Differing Doses of Caffeine or Breakfast](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207450802333995) - **$86 for 19 pages**
-   [Cognitive methods for assessing mental energy](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/nns/2007/00000010/f0020005/art00005) - **$48 for 14 pages**
-   [Mental Energy](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289605000279) - **$31 for 4 pages**
-   [The Effects of Ginseng, Ephedrine, and Caffeine on Cognitive Performance, Mood and Energy](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1753-4887.2001.tb06995.x/abstract) - **$42 for 4 pages**

$6.5 per page on average. _$6.5 per page_! I understand these publishers have small sales volumes, but this is beyond ridiculous. Who even buys these things? Universities? That's nice I guess. But I'm not part of a university. I'm writing the book independently and on a shoe-string budget. But I am not welcome in the ivory tower of academia. Keep this in mind next time you complain about the poor state of scientific reporting in the media. Outsiders are not welcome.
