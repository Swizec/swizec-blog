It is now 04:42 and it's about time I head off to bed since Wednesdays do in fact still exist, I don't know whose bright idea this was, but they had it and now we have it.



Yesterday I complained about falling asleep too early to do any serious amount of writing. Today however the problem is quite the opposite - I don't seem to be sleepy at all and yet, I have written even less than yesterday. The inspiration just wasn't there and yes, I know, [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/ "NaNoWriMo") is all about making us write even when inspiration is low and just fucking get on with it mister writer! WRITE god damn it!



Well I didn't. But I have read a whole bunch of interesting questions over at [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/ "Stack Overflow") and answered some of them (if you haven't read on twitter, I've decided to start paying-it-forward by answering at least one question a day). I also have created a spankingly fresh [LinkedIn account](http://www.linkedin.com/in/swizec).



If nothing extraordinary like me getting an inspiration in the moment after head-hits-pillow and brain-shuts-off happens this lapse in concentration makes me roughly 4000 words behind official schedule. \\o/



Who knows, tomorrow I might actually do something about that.



PS: I'm delaying this being posted to catch the early crowd on twitter, yes, I'm that lame.
