A few days ago, on Thursday to be precise, I stepped into the magnificent bookstore thing I usually go to in order to get my fix and there it was, waiting for me, the book I had ordered, The Ultimat Hitchhiker's Guide. It's an amazingly well written book with lots of funny little twists and turns and it even makes one laugh a lot. This edition supposedly has 5 novels and a story inside... so that's quite some reading material. 800 pages worth in fact.  
  
On the other hand there is mister Cthulhu, he has been calmly waiting under my bed to get another issue published and I assure you I am working full steam on it... well almost, I do take way too many breaks, anyway the issue is progressing and is turning out quite lovely. So just remain patient eh.
