Having been listening to this stuff I've grown a big and bloody huge inclination to getting absolutely plastered and do some stupid shit. And I'm quite possibly passing all the exams I have to this week so I can advance my MMORPG-life level and that needs to be celebrated with alcohol and drunkedness. Or I may not pass them and then my sorrows need to be drowned with alcohol and drunkedness. Also, I've been feeling lately as if there aren't enough traditions in the world and that we should start some new ones. So I came up with the idea of creating a traditional [end-of-all-uni-exams-of-the-year](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=151604063816&ref=mf) [pub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_house "Public house")&[bar crawl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_crawl "Pub crawl"). In this event I would drum up everyone I can possibly think of that could be going through something akin to passing all exams and might want to get plastered with a bunch of idiots. The idea is to start off at Zeleni Zajec this Friday at eight-ish and have a few drinks. Then move on to a nearby pub for a few more drinks. And so on and on ad nauseum until we can't possibly move further. I would be incredibly happy if many many people came because the more the merrier. Hey, maybe next year we can get some official t-shirts made and make the whole thing even more fun. It would also be very helpful if everyone who intends to come get drunk with us would kindly tag themselves on the [facebook grog fest](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=151604063816&ref=mf).
