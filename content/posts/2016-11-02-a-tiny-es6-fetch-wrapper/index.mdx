After [yesterday's shenanigans](link) with ES6 fetch(), I made a tiny library called [better-fetch](https://github.com/Swizec/better-fetch) which makes your life easier. Or at least it makes _my_ life easier. Without changing the API, better-fetch **automatically includes cookies**, which would have saved me a very frustrating amount of time yesterday, lets you **add default headers**, and you can **pass request body as a plain JS object**. None of that `FormData` nonsense. `better-fetch` works the same as `fetch()`, but is less cumbersome to use.

## In practice, better-fetch looks like this:

You install with npm. Or whatever you use to install packages from npmjs.org. Yarn maybe?

    $ npm install --save better-fetch

Then you set up headers that every one of your `fetch()` calls needs. My backend requires an `Authorization` and an `Accept` header from all calls.

    // top of project
    // src/index.js

    import fetch from 'better-fetch';

    fetch.setDefaultHeaders({
        Authorization: `Token token=${GlobalTokenValue}`,
        Accept: "application/json.v2"
    });

    // ^ this is optional and depends on your use-case ^

You can then use `better-fetch` anywhere in your code as you normally would with `fetch()`. The API feels the same and promises to work just like you'd expect.

    // any file
    import fetch from 'better-fetch';

    fetch('/api/some/thing')
      .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => {
            // do stuff
        });

This code fetches JSON document with a `GET` request to the `/api/some/thing` URL. Any default headers are set in the request and cookies are sent as well. POST-ing is also made less cumbersome:

    // any file
    import fetch from 'better-fetch';

    const data = {
        key: 'value',
        key2: 'value2'
    };

    fetch('/api/save_response', {method: 'POST',
                                 body: data})
              .then(response => response.json())
              .then(json => {
                  console.log(json);
              });

A dictionary `body` is automatically transformed into a `FormData` object, and strings and FormData objects are let through. This gives you flexibility to work with any API backend, but it still makes your life easier. Similarly, you can specify headers as either a `Headers` object or a dictionary â€“ better-fetch has you covered. Happy hacking ? PS: I know a bunch of [fetch wrappers](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=fetch) exist already. They all make significant changes to the API, and I wanted to avoid that.
