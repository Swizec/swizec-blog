Today the lovely [darkness fora](http://forum.darkness.com/index.php) blessed me with means to procuring some very nice steampunk links. There was [_Steampunk_](http://forum.darkness.com/index.php) - the new steampunk magazine, [_Brass Goggles_](http://www.brassgoggles.co.uk/brassgoggles/) - a very nice and frequently updated blog aobut this stuff and _[The Modern Compendum of Miniature Automata](http://www.lycettebros.com/automata/index.html)_ - which I can't quite describe, but you should check it out because it's fun.
