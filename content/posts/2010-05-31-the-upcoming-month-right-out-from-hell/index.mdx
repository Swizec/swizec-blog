That is correct, the exam season is upon us once again.



It's going to be a hellish few weeks and I'm already dreading climbing out of bed each and every day respectfully. Horrible horrible times are afoot.



This week I'm facing two midterms, one somewhat long paper and having to defend my homework before scrutiny. Next week it's three rather not very easy exams. Yikes!



And then nobody knows! I fully expect the one exam that's scheduled and the three oral exams partaining to the exams that are next week. Hoorah!



Oh well, the exam season will behave like the drunk daddy in a particular song methinks.
