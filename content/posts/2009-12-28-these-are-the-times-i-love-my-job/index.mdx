Today I spent five solid hours programming (so far) and didn't write a single line of code, nay, not even a single character. All I did was think with the whiteboard.



Eventually covering about 15 square meters of whiteboard in squiggly lines and weird characters and all sorts of stuff that I probably shouldn't explain in too great a detail publicly. Let it suffice to say that I believe to have solved the problem of translating machine vocabulary to personalised user vocabulary.
