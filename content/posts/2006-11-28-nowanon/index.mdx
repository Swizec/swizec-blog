Wow, can you imagine how time flies when you're trying to figure out a way to shove enough hours into the day to be able to finish all of the tasks at hand by Christmas. The thing is that I've probably gotten myself in too deep, there is the very lovely paid website project that has to be done and the small manner of three paintings I decided to do as holiday presents.

All in all it really adds up to the fact that the comic will be updated on time, in three days or so, and taht the news postings will go back to happening now and anon instead of anything like a schedule.

Many people are unfamiliar with the idiom _now and anon_ but it's really the best bloody idiom in the whole English language. Looking at it literally it seems more as an oxy moron where _now_ means at this very point in time and _anon_ means something along the lines of right away. Put them together and what do you get? You get a phrase that means seldom ... fantastic language.
