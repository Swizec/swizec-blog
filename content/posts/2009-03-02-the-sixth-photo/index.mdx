Another month, another online tagging meme and since I skipped the 23 things on facebook and another few I've decided to play along this time since @freeeky thinks I'm a good target for these things. Fine.

Apparently the gist of the matter is going into your albums collection and upload the sixth image from the sixth album ... why they didn't work-in another six in there to make it the number of the beast alludes my right now, but I'm sure it was for a good cause. So, since I don't really have an album collection per se I'm gonna fire up iPhoto and see what comes up in hopes it's nothing bad. Worse case scenario is you get to see a bit too much of my girlfriend.

I have no idea why anyone would want to look at this photo, but I guess it's a little bit funny.

Ok enough looking, she's mine ... I was supposed to tag more people, but I'll just tag the [girlfriend](http://3pike.blogspot.com/), because none of my contacts are cool enough to have personal blogs, just a bunch of stupid niche bloggers and nonbloggers.
