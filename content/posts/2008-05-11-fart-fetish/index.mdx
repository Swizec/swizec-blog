Fart fetishism is very close to fecophilia if you ask me - some people have both or either. As I've had the pleasure(?) of finding out I have neither, or at least I don't have a fart fetish. Yes it's kind of an interesting thing to try, but definitely not arousing in any way ...

Uhm ... yes, all things need to be tried out at least once, but only some things need to be done more than once. On top of that I don't really have much to say at this time ... this could be a nice essay-ish lengthy write up, but somehow my mind doesn't feel like thinking. More tea is required methinks.
