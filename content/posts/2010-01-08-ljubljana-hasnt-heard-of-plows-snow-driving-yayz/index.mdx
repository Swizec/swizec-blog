After tonight's midterm I simply couldn't resist driving around and about Ljubljana in this magnificent snowy weather we're having. It's very rare to get a chance to drive in conditions where everyone is nice and calm. Nobody honks at you, nobody tries to swerve around you and do stupid things, nobody is in a hurry. It's just fucking awesome! Not to mention the snow and the occasional drift around a corner! Orgasmic! Oh! Although winter services could be a little more vigilant, I got thrown all over the place driving through tracks others made. There was snow up to 20 centimeters deep someplaces! On main roads!! Anyway, had fun, was awesome, got stuck in the snow on the parking lot at home. That was a big lol, but a surprisingly large amount of people I don't know decided to be helpful and we got the car into a parking space in no time.
