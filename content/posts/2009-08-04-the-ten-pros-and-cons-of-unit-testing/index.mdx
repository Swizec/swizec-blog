Some of you may remember my writing about how [unit testing is anti-productive](http://swizec.com/blog/unit-testing-is-anti-productive/swizec/610) and those of you I have to disapoint, I still dont' think it's the best [productivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity "Productivity") tool out there. BUT! The past few days I had another go at unit testing while developing a "server" for gathering statistics on how people use [Twitulater](http://twitulater.com "Twitulater"). This was mostly in preparation for making a "server" for syncing Twitulater users, more on that some other day, it was mostly a learning exercise. What I learned was that:

1.  Unit testing is no guarantee for quality _(con)_
2.  Unit testing can be really cumbersome to use and more time can be spent finding a [test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing "Software testing") than solving the problem. Like for example: How do you test an app that reads from sys.stdin? _(con)_
3.  Unit testing only helps with bugs you've anticipated or found
