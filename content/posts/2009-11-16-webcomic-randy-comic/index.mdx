This is a comic I was working on around 2003 or 2004, perhaps 2005. It revolved around Randy, who was a hedgehog, and his adventures as a psychiatrist of a mad woman whose name I've forgotten. It changed formats plenty of times and was generally a mess and never really caught on. It doesn't seem like any finished images survived unfortunately, but I will scan the inks some day and put them here. There are, however, images from a 24hr comic challenge that survived. \[book id='2' /]
