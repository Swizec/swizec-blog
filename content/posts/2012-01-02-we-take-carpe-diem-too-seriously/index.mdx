Yesterday I received the best gift ever - a day completely off. Free.

_What's so special about a day off_, you might think, _I have like two every week!_ Or if you're more like me, you're thinking _Psh! Dude, I get a day off almost every month._



This was different - I had a day off from _me_.



None of my little rituals. No exercise in the morning. Not a single cup of tea. No jotting down random-ish actions into [Daytum](http://www.daytum.com/ "Daytum"). No tweeting. No instagraming. No marking down every bite into [myfitnesspal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/). No time trackers. No email. Nothing.



Even wrote the [750words](http://750words.com/) at almost midnight.



For a whole day I completely threw away every little thing I do day after day that doesn't bring a rush of oxytocin there and then. Yes, I will continue doing all those things today, no, none of it is particularly useful, yes, they all tickle the nerd inside me.



I took one more step. I didn't worry about the pile of email I'd return to. The day's lull in my data, or the delay in stuff I'm working on.



A day like there's no tomorrow! Carpe Diem is fine and all, but dear god we all take it so seriously. When did we collectively forget to _enjoy ourselves_? That Carpe Diem wasn't \[just] about working day and night to get the upper hand on your competition ...



It felt great and against all expectations, my life is not a barren wasteland today.



I didn't devolve into a fumbling beast, all my good \[and bad] habits are still there. I'm still posting my daily blog. Still tweeting like mad. And still dutifully recording all the useless data about my life. I will even do some work despite Jan 2nd being a public holiday.



If you didn't do anything even remotely like this yesterday - shame on you! You're an even bigger nutcase than I am!



Give it a try tomorrow, I dare you.
