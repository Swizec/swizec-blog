Lately we have seen a plague of Next Better Widget (tm) startups and bright minds all over the world solving frivolous problems that ultimately contribute nothing to the betterment of humanity as a whole. There are a bunch of people out there right now solving [#firstworldproblems](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23FirstWorldProblems).



A waste of talent!



By being in the same boat I feel like I am betraying my ten year old self who had much bigger plans for me. His ideas on what sort of problems I should be solving was much worthier than what I have actually turned out to be working on.



The main difference between my ten year old self and me is [the internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").



Back then I didn't have it, or rather what I did have was at a friend's house on a dial-up line if I asked really nicely. Sometimes even at the library!



The ideas I had back then might not have been world changing, or they might have been, it's hard to say, but the ideas I have right now certainly don't seem as grand.



This leads me to believe that the ideas we have reflect the kind of world we live in.



Spending a lot of time on the internet makes us see the problems that exist there. And they look like big \\important problems. But really, when you take a step or two back, they're pretty lame ideas that are almost a waste of time to have anyone working on.



Thus I have decided to go offline for a month, starting tomorrow.



But because going completely dark would devastate my life, probably make it stop dead (how unlike an addict eh?), I am going to set some ground rules that won't ban the internet completely; just make it a bit ... less.

- as a coding reference, the internet is ok
- wikipedia is alright, but keep it down
- I will continue writing my blog
- using [750words.com](http://750words.com) every morning is good
- there will be at most an hour every evening of HN/fb/twitter/email
- if something absolutely spectacular happens you are allowed to tweet, no reading outside the hour!
- checking in to foursquare is questionable ... perhaps ban it?
- skype is ok

To mak sure my slight addiction doesn't get in the way I will likely use an [/etc/hosts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29 "Hosts (file)") hack and make sure facebook.com and similar don't load outside the allotted hour a day and I will turn off push notifications on everything on my phone. But I _will_ try to rough it at first.



Right now I have no idea how this experiment will pan out. Most likely I'll keep finding some sort of excuse for not doing it or I will break down in tears and cry in a fetal position in the corner. I might even start reading proper books again! That would be awesome.



Hopefully by the end of the 30 days I will have a less polluted perspective in the world.



Wish me luck!
