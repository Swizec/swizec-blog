This is probably the most fun [conversation](http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1012203&cid=25564795) I've ever had at four in the morning, certainly the most entertaining I've ever had on [slashdot](http://slashdot.org).

Seriously. I like the idea of doing research for the sake of research, and I would probably respect this more, except Microsoft keeps representing it as  
The coolest thing they have ever come up with.  
The future of computing.  
  
and it is neither, it is just cool research. It's so cute the way Microsoft has gotten all senile and out of touch in its old age.  
  
OK, off to do laundry now. When will they make a robot that does my laundry for me? Now THAT will be progress.

It's called a washing machine.

He's talking about a folding machine, and it would truly be a great invention. Just dump in the laundry and out comes a folded pile. Bonus if it sorts socks!

It's called a wife.
