Yesterday morning a friendly postman came ringing my doorbell, no not postman Pat, I wish, HA! This postman came bearing presents for me, I had to pay for the presents, but htey were still welcome. When the box was opened inside was waiting the Heat Deterrant System 2007 Ultra Max Pro, designed to keep summer heat away from you while you work on the computer.

I had ordered it last Friday and on Saturday came a temperature drop to very bearable early spring levels ... but whatever, the deterrant system shall still be of use later.

This is what was in the box, The Heat Deterrant System 2007 Ulttra Max Pro ... USB powered.

This is what was in the box when I was done with it. My very own Boxed Pussy.
