D3v4 has been out since June. That’s almost five months. That’s also just long enough to make my React+D3.js ES6 book crazy outdated and to fill my inbox with emails saying, _"Yo, all your code is broken.”_



Yes, all my code is broken, and I'm [working on an update](https://swizec.com/blog/work-on-reactd3js-es6-v2-begins-in-earnest/swizec/7010). There were a ton of changes in D3v4, but how different is it, really?



Not that different! The [Levenshtein distance](https://swizec.com/blog/levenshtein-distance-in-haskell/swizec/4801) between a D3v3 histogram and a D3v4 histogram is only 82. It takes 82 1-character edits to go from a D3v3 histogram to a D3v4 histogram.



That might sound like a bunch of edits, but the D3v4 example is a whopping 1026 characters. The D3v3 version is 1050.



It’s 24 characters shorter and only 7.8% different. That doesn't sound so bad, does it?



Here's a D3v3 histogram of a movie weekend dataset I found on a [list of datasets by the Journal of Statistical Education](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/jse_data_archive.htm). It uses ES6 and pure D3 without React.

We load some data with `d3.tsv`, build a histogram with `d3.layout.histogram`, set up a linear scale for each axis, and add a `rect` to the SVG for each histogram entry.



Now here’s the same dataset in D3v4:



\[codepen_embed height="265" theme_id="0" slug_hash="wzOddx" default_tab="result" user="swizec"]See the Pen [Histogram D3v4](http://codepen.io/swizec/pen/wzOddx/) by Swizec Teller ([@swizec](http://codepen.io/swizec)) on [CodePen](http://codepen.io).\[/codepen_embed]



Same unstyled result, and the code looks samey too.



Here are the differences:



- `d3.layout.histogram` becomes `d3.histogram`
- `.bins` becomes `.thresholds`
- `d3.scale.linear` becomes `d3.scaleLinear`
- `d.x+d.dx` becomes `d.x1`
- `d.y` becomes `d.length`
- `d.dx` becomes `d.x1-d.x0`



Some of the API has been moved around and renamed to make more sense. Thresholds make more sense than bins, but scaleLinear vs. scale.linear… eh… sure. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯_



The biggest difference lies in histogram's return value. Where before we would get an array of arrays with additional `x`, `y`, and `dx` values, we now get just `x0` and `x1`.



I like the `x0, x1` approach because it tells us the lower and upper bound of each interval. This means less typing and thinking overhead in all cases except for one – when you do need the width. And I like the idea of relying on `length` instead of having an extra `y` property that's the same as `length`.



I like all the changes, and I think they improve the library by leaps and bounds. But it's these subtle differences that are the most annoying to catch.



Curiously, D3v3 calculates a bin width of 1962.5, and D3v4 gets 2000. Same data, same amount of bins. ?



Want more about the differences between D3v3 and D3v4? I'm thinking of making a cheatsheet.
