A few nights ago I heard strange noises in the dark and was almost mildly scared by them, but I did not freat, I quietly hid under my bed and waited for them to pass wondering what was the cause of the mystery and scary events.

Then some time later when the lights were on I came upon an interesting sight and suddenly realised what the cause of scary sounds in the night was ... a brave kitty hunting down spinning blades on my [Heat Deterrant System](http://swizec.com/index.php/mode=news/id=232).

Haha, youtube made it darker ... too bad.
