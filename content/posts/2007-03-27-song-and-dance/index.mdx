Yesterday upon arriving to my abode and checking [myspace](http://myspace.com/swizec), which I do now and anon, believe it or not, I was greeted by a friend invite and a message from one[Lionel Lodge](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=58513191). He was offering his new song about [Monk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Monk) to all the fans, or anyone really, who would like to hear it. Haven't actually had the chance to give it a listen yet but it just seems like such a nice gesture to be offering something like music for free even though it's merely for promotional purposes.

Another thing that's really biting at my nerves right now is how schools appear to have a complete lack of thought for students who might actually like a keyboard that can be used in proper quick typing and not having to have a deadly waltz with it every bloody time.
