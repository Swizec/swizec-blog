[Blogres came](http://swizec.com/index.php/mode=news/id=329) and went and now it's over. I've arleady written a blog about it on poper's site, and don't really like writing another right now. But I will say this: my photo is on the bloody frontpage of blogres! I swear there was this photographer who kept taking close-up photos of me and even though I don't really know what happened to the lot of them, one made it to the front page.
