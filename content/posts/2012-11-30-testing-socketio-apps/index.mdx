Socket.io is probably one of the coolest things to come out of the [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") world in recent years. Finally! Something that lets [web developers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer "Web developer") create real-time apps without the fuss of thinking about websockets and [long polling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology "Push technology") and all the other hacks that need to be used.



The idea is pretty simple, the server can emit an event and the [client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_%28computing%29 "Client (computing)") will pick it up. The converse also happens. [Callbacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_%28computer_programming%29 "Callback (computer programming)") through the server-client barrier works as well. Socket.io takes care of deciding which of the real-time hacks should be used to make the magic happen.



Thing is, the interplay of client and server makes socket.io apps a bit difficult to test.



A good way I've found is the combination of [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [socket.io-client](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-client).

## First, something to test

Let's take for example a very simple echo server. I used [Express](http://expressjs.com/) to make things easier to play with in the Chrome console. Here's the relevant part of _app.js_.

```
var server = exports.server = http.createServer(app).listen(app.get('port'), function(){
  console.log("Express server listening on port " + app.get('port'));
});

var io = require('socket.io').listen(server);
io.set("log level", 0);
```

```
// the \important parts of echo server
io.sockets.on("connection", function (socket) {
    socket.on("echo", function (msg, callback) {
        callback = callback || function () {};

        socket.emit("echo", msg);

        callback(null, "Done.");
    });
});
```

After not forgetting to load _/socket.io/socket.io.js_ into the index page, I can now run the server, point my browser to _http&#x3A;//localhost:3000_ and play around in the console like this:

```
> var socket = io.connect("http://localhost:3000")
undefined
> socket.on("echo", function (msg) { console.log(msg); })
SocketNamespace
> socket.emit("echo", "Hello World")
SocketNamespace
Hello World
```

## Automating the test

Typing commands into a console, even clicking around a webpage is a rather arduous and boring process. The easiest way I've found to automate this is using Mocha and socket.io-client.



First thing we're going to need is requiring everything and making sure the socket.io server is running.

```
var chai = require('chai'),
    mocha = require('mocha'),
    should = chai.should();

var io = require('socket.io-client');

describe("echo", function () {

    var server,
        options ={
            transports: ['websocket'],
            'force new connection': true
        };

    beforeEach(function (done) {
        // start the server
        server = require('../app').server;

        done();
    });
```

See, simple :)



Now comes the interesting part, the actual test making sure our server does in fact echo what we ask it to.

```
    it("echos message", function (done) {
        var client = io.connect("http://localhost:3000", options);

        client.once("connect", function () {
            client.once("echo", function (message) {
                message.should.equal("Hello World");

                client.disconnect();
                done();
            });

            client.emit("echo", "Hello World");
        });
    });
```

The idea behind this test is simple:

1. Connect client to server
2. Once there's a connection, listen for _echo_ event from the server
3. Emit _echo_event to the server
4. Server responds and triggers our listener
5. Listener checks correctness of response
6. Disconnects client

Disconnecting clients after tests is **_very \\important_**. As I've discovered, not disconnecting can lead to the socket accumulating [event listeners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern "Observer pattern"), which in turn can fire completely different tests than what you expect. It also leads to tests that pass 70% of the time, but fail in random ways.



In the end, our efforts are rewarded by a happy nyan cat.
