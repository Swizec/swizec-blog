Yesterday was happy fun times at the beach day and the times were both happy, sunny and jolly. I even got to see a wench or two in a [bikini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini "Bikini")! Score! I should perhaps note that I was surprised at the amount of old and wrinkly people [sunbathing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_tanning "Sun tanning") in incredibly skimpy outfits and the immense lack of young wenches doing similar without their tops.
