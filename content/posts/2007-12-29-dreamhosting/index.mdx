A few days ago I got kind of fed up of relying on a free hosting service provided me by my friends at [unimatrix-one](http://unimatrix-one.org/) and shelved out the moneys needed for [dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/). It's surprisingly little for what you actually get if you ask me.

Upon registering I was offered a [free domain](http://3pike.org/) to go with the hosting and having no better ideas at the time I did what any geek with a girlfriend would do. I made a [domain](http://3pike.org/) out of my wench's nickname. Sure, at first I did intend it to be her blog because she is using something completely unfit for a geek's girlfriend, but as she said she doesn't need one I put up a [picture](http://3pike.org/) of her. She loved the gesture, hates the picture ... and that's exactly why I chose that particular one.

As for [dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/), they seem quite nice so far. Responsiveness is superbly quick and I have more space than I could ever imagine I'd need, with said space increasing weekly, amazing. The monthly, I think it's monthly, transfer is also something I will probably never exceed ... and also increases weekly. Should the need ever arise I can even get a dedicated host ... lovely.

So yeah, so far I'm pleased with dreamhost and it gave me a fun day, because what better can a geek want than a completely new hosting account to play with and set stuff up?
