Often with student films of all kind the product is a bit lacking in many frontiers. Usually these can be acredited to low budgets and young people with little experience. I've sat through a showing of several student films once or twice in my life and the programme was two hours long, by the end of which I thought I would poke my eyes out rather than suffer onward.

Then sometimes you get things like what Joel Furtado created in [Tree for two](http://joelfurtado.com/). He claims the 6 minute 3D animated short took eight months to produce from concept to finish and I think it was totally worth it. The movements are so natural you almsot forget it's not done with modern animation techoniliges utilised by hollywood; the only exeption to the rule seems to be the dog's lower jaw, which just looks a bit odd.
