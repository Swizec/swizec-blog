Last night I watched a bloody amazing video of a university professor who was just **oozing awesome**. Seriously, this guy is all kinds of cool and I would love to someday have a professor that structures his lectures and classes like this guy does.



Now watch the video, I'm not here to blab, I'm here to make you watch this :)
