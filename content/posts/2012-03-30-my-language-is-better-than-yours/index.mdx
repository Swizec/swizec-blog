> My language brings all the geeks to the yard, And they're like "It's better than yours" Damn right, it's better than yours, I can teach you, but I have to charge

[Programming languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") - the second favourite thing for geeks to fight about (right after code editors and [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment")'s).

Everybody knows [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/ "Java (programming language)") sucks, that [PHP](http://www.php.net "PHP") is a script kiddie's tool and that [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29 "Lisp (programming language)") is the most magnificent thing ever to crawl out of the [primordial ooze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis") of academic language research.



Ask somebody else and suddenly everyone knows [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") is the best thing since sliced bread and Java is only used by weird people of the Indian persuasion ... and [Google](http://google.com "Google"). For some reason.



Does all of this really matter?



At the end of the day most languages are turing complete, which means you can use any language to do anything. Write your next [killer app](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application "Killer application") in [brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) for all I care. You should do it in [malbolge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge) actually, that will make the whole geek community green with envy.



But you know what, your app doesn't win based on the technology you use, _users don't care!_ What matters is solving an actual problem.



There's still no excuse for any [modern language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_language "Modern language") to exist without type inference though ...



[Uncovering the Unknown: Principles of Type Inference](http://screencasts.chariotsolutions.com/webpage/2011/10) - an awesome talk explaining exactly _why_there is no excuse for making people type _int_ and _char_ in 2012.



I'm looking at you Java.
