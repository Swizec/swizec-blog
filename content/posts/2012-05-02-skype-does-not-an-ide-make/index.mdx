[![Skype not an IDE](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-02-at-3.42.28-PM.png "Skype not an IDE")](./img/Screen-Shot-2012-05-02-at-3.42.28-PM.png) This is the screen I've been staring into for most of the day. It's horrible. No way for a man to [code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code "Code"). Or a woman. Or anyone really. If I had a child, this would be how I ground them - restrict [text editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor "Text editor") access to [Skype](http://skype.com "Skype"). Why was I doing this all day you ask? A few days ago I decided to launch a small experiment - for this I needed a small icon. [@ponywithhiccups](https://twitter.com/ponywithhiccups) bravely stepped up to the task and got to work. After some days of back and forth we came up with a design both can be happy with. Bit of advice: _meet up in person_ if at all possible. Especially for design. Then I asked her to code it all up in [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets "Cascading Style Sheets") and [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML"). You know, because I'm lazy and she can totally handle that and I have far less important things to do than implementing my own experiments. With a huff and a puff she got to work. Everything was going _so well._ Right up to the point she finally decided she has no idea what's going on and I should step in to help. Via Skype. Very well then, how hard can it be to lend a helping hand in coding some CSS? CSS is, like, totally child's play. I can write CSS in my sleep! Turns out, via Skype, not so much.

## Human = text editor

Perhaps the problem wasn't Skype so much as it was [pair programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming "Pair programming") to use another [human being](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human")as a text editor. The only real issue Skype introduced was making the screen blurry and occasionally locking up so I could only see changes with a slight delay. \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Look! It's paired programming! (Photo credit: Wikipedia)"][![Look! It's paired programming!](./img/300px-Pair_programming_1.jpg "Look! It's paired programming!")](http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pair_programming_1.jpg)\[/caption] Using another human as a text editor, though, that was just painful. The way I work is very messy -> I jump around the screen, scroll up and down, add a dot on line 10, write a row at line 100, refresh the browser, change some HTML, look at twitter, refresh the browser, change line 50, remove lines 10-20, add 5 lines, move the 5 lines fifty lines up. And so on. This works because I can keep the whole codebase in memory. But it's _vital_that jumping around the file happens as quickly as it does in my head. Any delay feels like somebody was dragging a barbed wire through my brain while pulling the handbrake on my thoughts and chugging a refrigerator out the window. You know, that feeling you get when you're trying to code, but the computer is being slow? Multiply it by 10 and add the computer asking _"Uh, what do you mean?" "Are you sure?"_ and every now and then _"OH! I know what you are going to say in 25 seconds!"_ ... and then doing the wrong thing. No fault to @ponywithhiccups of course, she's just starting out with this stuff and I should have gone to her in person - we'd be done in half the time. Pointing at the screen with your finger and saying _"Right there, just fix that!"_ doesn't work either. BUT! In the end we prevailed and that's **_awesome_**. I also learned a bunch about css3 animations; that stuff is fascinating. The things you can do, wow.
