Yesterday was an all over bad day it would seem, I was preoccupied with sleeping in front of the telly to write this blog and in hopes of such a coincidentiality being avoided today I'm writing as early as 1700 ... as if that was super early, but hey, all is well if the blog is done right?

Sadly, no. Due to some thing or another I haven't managed to write even a thousand words all since Friday and yeah, you guessed it, that's really bad, I'm too daunted by the fact to even calculate just how much behind schedule I am, it's that scary. In all factuality I believe that fussing about wordcount at this moment would cause too much "omg" to provide a good working atmosphere, so I'll rather focus on writing as much as is possible and hope for the best.

On the other hand ... I did manage to write a whooping 300 words at school today, which acciedentally also happens to be the complete wordcount of today so far.
