Was really looking forward to making today's blog a review of [SteamPunk Magazine](http://www.steampunkmagazine.com/), but it so happened that I haven't really managed to read it yet so all I can say about it thusfar is that it's a rather nicely built item with some very solid reading and interesting things. It's so interesting as to get stolen by a classmate ... If you're looking into reading this, you should go paper because electrons just don't do it justice.
