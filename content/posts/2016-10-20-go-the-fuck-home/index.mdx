This 5 minute talk by Pam Selle is a thing of beauty. Watch it.





Here are the key points. Honestly though, she expresses them much better than I do, so watch the video →



- **You are a business asset**. You’re worth $X to your company. Your company knows the X… do you know the X?
- The more hours you work, the less money you’re making for your time.
- Every time you stay late after work, you’re giving that time away for free.
- Do side projects. Maybe even side projects that make money. ;)
- **You only stay late because you can’t do your work.** Do your work at work. Get off Facebook, make the shit you want to happen happen, and go the fuck home when you’re done.
- When you work overtime, \*\*your productivity goes down. \*\*
- If you are good at your job, you should get it done in the time allotted.
- **Get a Life**
- Have an escape plan: schedule something right after work so that you’re forced to go the fuck home
- **Be an example for your team**. Don’t perpetuate the “stay later to look loyaler” arms race. It’s dumb.
- **Be happy.** Happier people are more productive, and if you’re more productive, you make more money. Everyone loves more money.



You know what makes you happy? Having a life. Know what makes it possible to have a life? Going the fuck home.



PS: If you’re a founder or have millions of dollars of your net worth in the company, this advice does not apply. You pour your heart and soul into that fucker, and **remember to tell your employees to go the fuck home**.
