After several years of writing this blog it has suddenly dawned on me that there should be some sort of contact information available, so people can ... contact me and pester me with their requests and whatnot. Perhaps I'll get some spam out of the ordeal and if all goes well, a request to have some lucky harlot's babies. Or, you know, if you're some sort of employer looking for a developer or whatever, I even do competitions in interesting fields, do feel free to use any of the following vectors of reaching me, because ... ... I can be reached via Twitter: http&#x3A;//twitter.com/swizec ... I can be reached on LinkedIn: http&#x3A;//www.linkedin.com/in/swizec ... I can also be reached via e-mail: swizec \[at] swizec \[dot] com ... I can sometimes be found traversing the real life events in [Ljubljana](<http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.0513888889,14.5055555556&spn=0.1,0.1&q=46.0513888889,14.5055555556 (Ljubljana)&t=h> "Ljubljana"). Just look for a man with a funny hat ... and I always read the comments on this blog so comment away my dearies.
