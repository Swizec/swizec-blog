Writing this I wanted to create an epic war novel focusing on the differencies of anachronistic monarchism and modern democracy, but a flawed creation model - trying to edit while writing - killed it before it reached anywhere near what I wanted to say. The writing itself is actually pretty good imho, I might some day return to this.
