Well this post was supposed to go up last night but I somehow managed to fall asleep watching Sherlock Holmes before the water for tea boiled. Go figure.

Anyway, an interview was filmed with me yesterday and even though it was the first such thing to happen to me, I had quite some fun doing it. It was nothing of the professional sort as was apparent by the whole lack of preparation of both parties and that I somehow wasn't allowed to go into long rambles, which I'd like, but maybe they just weren't eloquent enough. I should really work on my speaking eloquency ... When I get it the interview goes up on youtube of course.

Because I feel like it here is also a [panoramic shot](http://flickr.com/photos/7280946@N06/474283871/) of my favourite tea house that feeds me tea nigh on every day.
