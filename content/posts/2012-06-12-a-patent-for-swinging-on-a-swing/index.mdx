The patent system has gone bonkers the past few years. For proof, look no further than this wonderful gem:

> A method of swing on a swing is disclosed, in which a user positioned on a standard swing suspended by two chains from a substantially horizontal tree branch induces side to side motion by pulling alternatively on one chain and then the other.

On April 9th, 2002 the US patent office issued a patent for _[A Method of Swinging on a Swing](http://www.google.com/patents/US6368227)._On July 1st, 2003 it was reexamined and all claims cancelled, but for a whopping 13 months this was a valid issued patent and, in theory, you could get sued for swinging in a particular way without asking permission. Yep. [![The patented swinging](http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-Shot-2012-06-11-at-12.04.45-AM.png "The patented swinging")](./img/Screen-Shot-2012-06-11-at-12.04.45-AM.png) After describing a short history of swinging (did you know swings were patented in 1881?) - the back-and-forth and the ever so popular screw-and-spin methods - the patent claims that:

> These methods of swinging on a swing although of considerable interest to some people can lose their appeal with age and experience. **A new method of swinging on a swing would therefore represent an advance of great significance and value.**

To swing like _Figure 2_ shows - side-to-side instead of front-to-back - one must merely pull on each chains alternatively. Similar to how you shift your body weight for normal swinging. A bit of imagination can make the new swinging method even more fun:

> Lastly, it should be noted that because pulling alternately on one chain and then the other resembles in some measure the movements one would use to swing from vines in a dense jungle forest, the swinging method of the present invention may be referred to by _the present inventor and his sister_ as **"Tarzan" swinging.**The user may even choose to produce a Tarzan-type yell while swinging in the manner described, which more accurately replicates swinging on vines in a dense jungle forest. Actual jungle forestry is not required.

My swing can be a jungle vine and I can pretend to be Tarzan! No jungle forestry required! Scoar! However, it is possible to make the whole thing even more fun by incorporating back-to-front swinging to produce an oval motion - you should be careful that the side-to-side axis is longer though, otherwise it isn't as fun. Apparently.

> Licenses are available from the inventor upon request.

Which is great because my first thought after sitting on a piece of wood suspended from a bar has always been asking someone's permission to swing.
