Some websites out there simply have a fascinating and breath taking design. They are few and far between and nonsurprisingly almost always a personal website of some graphic artist trying to make themselves known or simply to share their stuff. [Maria J. Williams](http://www.mariawilliam.net/) seems to be one such person. The website is simply the best design I've ever had the honour of noticing.
